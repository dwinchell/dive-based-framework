ai-insights: |
  - Completing the scope task was a big emotional release and may have led to that need for decompression.  
  - Today may still require active recovery to address accumulated tiredness and avoid starting the next work cycle depleted. Consider early wind down tonight.

reflectoins:
  - I stayed up watching anime. This was a high stimuls activity binge. It started as comfort seeking after a stressful day, and led to hyperfocus and reinforced behavior, which led to sleep disruption. This ends my approximately 8 day streak of falling to sleep at a consistent time (01:30) and sets back my project to fix my sleep.
