  - "Missing both planned EVE fleets amplified feelings of disappointment and prevented mental disengagement."
  - "Social obligations reduced available time for priority tasks without providing significant recovery."
  - "Relational time with wife was a key emotional positive."
  - "Tomorrow may benefit from deliberate closure of remaining work and a reset to prevent cognitive carryover."
