      reflections:
        - Wind down exceeded target (1h → ~1h 40m) due to hygiene, wife convo, and BAR
        - BAR may have gone long but effectively interrupted work rumination
        - Entered bed quite sleepy; may offset duration drift

      - type: Gaming Dive
        time: Afternoon–02:00
        description: Open-ended gaming session for hobby enjoyment and stress relief
        outcome: Successful; played until 02:00 and considered the experience worth it
        notes: >
          No external obligations conflicted. Fulfilled emotional goal of decompressing, reconnecting with hobby enjoyment. Acceptable tradeoff of late sleep.

    mood_notes:
      - time: Morning
        mood: High
        notes: Mild cyclothymia feeling; energized and elevated mood

    naps:
      - time: 14:00–14:10
        duration: 10 minutes
        context: >
          Post-lunch, post-exercise, napped next to partner.
          Emotional comfort likely key to falling asleep quickly; post-exercise fatigue and postprandial relaxation may have contributed.
        outcome: Fell asleep quickly and naturally.
        post_attempt: >
          Attempted to continue napping alone afterward, but unable to return to sleep due to wandering thoughts.
        hypothesis_links:
          - Napping with Partner Improves Sleep Onset and Depth (confirming)
          - Strenuous Exercise Accelerates Sleep Debt Recovery (supporting, minor)

    to_do:
      - Refill meds: Completed

    wind_down:
      protocol_used: None (WDP skipped)
      activities:
        - Refilled meds
        - Basic hygiene (brushed teeth)
        - Poe playlist (started after getting in bed)
      total_wind_down_time: 15 minutes (prior to bed) + passive audio during sleep onset
      pre_wind_down_context: >
        - High-stimulus gaming dive. Full brightness TV, lit room, mentally active state.
        - Vigorous exercise earlier in the day (45 minutes, 32 min in vigorous HR zone).
        - Predominantly relaxed, low-stress emotional state throughout the day due to gaming dive.
      notes: >
        Intentionally skipping WDP tonight to observe effects.
        Contextual factors (exercise, gaming relaxation) may positively or negatively influence sleep onset and quality.
        Passive Poe playlist may provide minor calming influence.
        Valuable for hypothesis testing on necessity of structured wind-down versus cumulative day effects.

      wake_reason: Bladder likely contributed to waking
      reflections: >
        - Felt rested on waking; slept well despite short duration.
        - Could have used a bit more sleep, but overall functional.
        - Experienced long, vivid dreams, suggesting deeper sleep cycles were achieved.
        - Overall, a pretty good result for 6 hours of sleep, especially considering skipped WDP.

        heart_rate_zones:
          vigorous: 26 minutes
          peak: 8 minutes
        description: Morning workout session
        notes: >
          Uncharacteristic burst of morning energy.
          Main heart rate zone was vigorous, with a notable period in peak zone.
          No external pressure; internally motivated. Positive anomaly.

      - type: Relational Dive
        time: Afternoon
        participants: Mom (plus siblings, unexpectedly)
        goals: 
          - Enjoy relationship
          - Support emotional wellbeing
          - Exchange items
          - Help with projects
          - Identify trees together
        outcome: >
          Dive went great. Emotional goals were fully met.
          Unexpectedly planted trees with mom and her siblings — created a memory that will be long-lasting.
          Significant additional physical exertion contributed to post-dive tiredness.
        reflections:
          - Felt good emotionally afterward; positive bonding and support achieved.
          - Physical fatigue from double exercise (morning workout + afternoon planting).
          - Planting trees together was an especially meaningful and memorable experience.
          - Presence of extended family made the dive more emotionally significant than planned.

      - type: Nap
        time: 19:30–19:45
        duration: 15 minutes
        context: >
          Short nap in the car after relational dive and cumulative physical exertion.
          Likely triggered by combination of physical fatigue and emotional decompression.
        outcome: Brief but restorative nap.

      - type: Gaming Dive
        time: 22:00–00:00
        description: High-stimulus gaming session
        intent: Decompression, entertainment
        stimulation_level: High
        notes: >
          Evening gaming dive focused on high-stimulus content.
          Purpose was decompression after physically and emotionally full day.
          Timing may affect sleep onset; monitoring outcome.

    mood_notes:
      - time: Morning
        mood: High
        notes: >
          Woke with slightly elevated mood.
          Exercise dive further increased mood and emotional energy.

    physical_condition_notes:
      - time: Morning
        physical_state: Significant DOMS
        notes: >
          Experiencing noticeable delayed onset muscle soreness from previous exercise.
          Present before today's dive; may influence later energy levels.

    wind_down:
      start_time: 00:30
      initial_content: DUST sci-fi shorts
      initial_outcome: >
        Ineffective — too stimulating.
        Each short was individually engaging and encouraged continued watching, making it hard to step down.
      adjustment: Switched to Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      final_content: Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      final_outcome: >
        More effective — familiar and less stimulating than DUST shorts.
        Helped create the emotional and cognitive step-down needed for sleep preparation.
      in_bed_time: 02:00
      pre_sleep_routine:
        - 5mg dissolvable melatonin
        - Poe playlist started
      notes: >
        Executed final sleep cues (melatonin + Poe) after winding down with BAR.
        Completed adjusted wind-down strategy after initially rocky start.

      total_sleep: ~6.5h
      reflections: >
        Main sleep was solid despite late sleep onset.
        Woke naturally due to circadian pulse at 8:30, consistent with past rhythm patterns.
        Additional 30 minutes of fragmented dozing added marginal rest but not full sleep cycles.
        Woke feeling tired this morning, likely cumulative physical load.

    wind_down:
      start_time: 00:30
      intended_strategy: >
        Initiate standard wind-down after relational dive.
        Goal was gradual cognitive and emotional deceleration toward sleep.
      actual_outcome: >
        Got stuck watching YouTube videos on phone between 00:30–01:30.
        High-stimulus content prolonged cognitive activation.
        Wind-down was largely ineffective during this window.
      adjustment: >
        After initial disruption, initiated a second wind-down effort: a 30-minute minimal bedtime routine (brushing teeth, basic hygiene).
        Helped partially reset cognitive state and support transition into bed.
      notes: >
        Failure to shift environment or reduce stimulus cues likely contributed.
        Remaining in a stimulation-associated environment (phone use, bright screen) encouraged continued input-seeking behavior rather than disengagement.

      additional_sleep: 09:45–10:15 (Sleep Inertia Phase)
      total_sleep_estimate: ~7h 30m
      reflections:
        - Sleep onset delayed by disrupted wind-down but not catastrophically.  Lack of winddown and high stimulus and light levels within 30 min of target sleep time pushed onset time back by 15 min but did not disrupt sleep quality. Suggests that I can get away with these things under certain conditions (no other sleep-impairing situations, and no required target wakeup time). Negative evidence for any related ongoing hypotheses. Want to avoid risking it in the future.
        - Main sleep was adequate in total duration due to no need to wake up early.
        - Woke naturally without bladder or alarm trigger.
        - Final 30 minutes characterized by Sleep Inertia Phase: conscious but not fully alert, body still felt heavy and comfortable, pleasant.

            focus: Capturing ideas for Pre-Sales Tiger Team
            notes: Stimulated post-walk; used writing to capture ideation burst.
          - duration: 3h (12:00–15:00)
            focus: Ardian presales meetings and analysis
            notes: Sustained cognitive effort preparing for and following up on Ardian-related presales work.
          - duration: 1h (15:00–16:00)
            focus: Pre-Sales Tiger Team follow-up
            notes: Returned to strategic planning and idea refinement. Creative energy still present but SR/EF now notably depleted.

      - type: Nap
        time: 17:30–20:00
        duration: 2h 30m
        context: >
          Followed an extended 5-hour work dive without structured recovery.
          Likely triggered by accumulated SR/EF depletion.
        outcome: >
          Substantial nap duration suggests significant recovery need.
          May impact sleep onset timing tonight.
          Important to monitor mood, SR/ER restoration, and wind-down effectiveness later.

      - type: Work Touch Ritual
        time: 22:30-23:00
        description: CER Touch Protocol
        protocol_details:
          - Set 2-minute timer
          - Open CER document
          - Write at least one word
          - Observe contents for full duration
          - No obligation to continue
        intent: >
          Reduce anxiety and avoidance.
          Re-establish cognitive familiarity with the document.
          Prime the nervous system for deeper engagement later.
        outcome: >
          Protocol succeeded in reducing anxiety and avoidance.
          Continued briefly past 2-minute timer and created a structured outline with inline to-dos.
          This will lower the activation energy for the next dive.

      - type: Gaming Dive
        time: 23:30–01:30
        game: EVE Online
        stimulation_level: Moderate
        description: Intentional low-EF, high-agency dive
        outcome: >
          Matched intended criteria: active participation without significant creative or executive load.
          Numbers went up. Rocks were shot. Eventually disengaged naturally.
          Served as gentle deceleration dive before sleep.

    in_bed:
      time: 01:30
      notes: >
        Transitioned directly to bed after gaming session.
        No high-stimulus residue reported.

    sleep:
      sleep_onset: ~02:30
      pre_sleep_audio: Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      wake_time_core: 08:00 (woke from bad dream, fighting theme)
      additional_sleep: 08:00–09:00 (fragmented, ended due to full bladder)
      total_sleep_estimate: ~6h 30m
      reflections: >
        Long delay to sleep onset despite relaxing content (BAR).
        Core sleep disrupted by emotionally intense dream.
        Final hour was fragmented; full rest not achieved.
        Sleep pressure likely reduced but not fully reset.
        Morning SR may be compromised; recovery pacing advised.

    mood_notes:
      - time: 11:00
        mood: Low
        emotional_state: Anxious
        medication_context: >
          0.5mg Klonopin taken at 09:00.
          Still feeling physiological effects, but anxiety and low mood persisted.
        notes: >
          Mood not significantly improved despite partial chemical dampening.
          Suggests underlying emotional/neurological load not fully resolved by medication alone.

    physical_condition_notes:
      - time: Morning
        update_type: Recovery
        condition: DOMS
        notes: DOMS no longer present.

      - time: Evening
        update_type: Resolution
        condition: Right elbow
        notes: Elbow injury from earlier this week has fully healed.

    reflections:
      - time: Evening
        notes: >
          Attempted a light jog but had to abort due to minor foot injury.
          The issue wasn't inability to push through — it was that this level of activity used to be harmless.
          Realization: my body is now more vulnerable to minor injury from things that once felt like warmups.
          Grieving that change — it's not about effort or toughness, but about recognizing shifting physiological limits.

      - time: Retrospective on April 30
        notes: >
          Tuesday (4/29) was a perfect opportunity for writing: I was well rested, the calendar was clear, and I had strong intention.
          I knew in advance that the DAS CER needed attention and that this window was critical in the context of the week’s workload.

          An unexpected errand emerged that morning.
          I did attempt to minimize disruption by preserving a contiguous block in the evening, but I underestimated the emotional regulation (ER) cost of the errand.
          The errand had social friction and uncertainty, which drained SR more than I expected.

          In retrospect, I could have deferred the errand to the following morning.
          That would have required:
            - Recognizing how critical the day was in context
            - Spending EF to coordinate with my partner and the vendor
            - Managing my emotions about my partner’s recovery needs
            - Possibly accepting minor financial cost

          It was doable — but I didn’t give myself permission to make that tradeoff or pause long enough to see it as a justifiable move.

          The misstep was not in running the errand, but in underestimating its systemic cost and overestimating my ability to recover from it mid-day.
