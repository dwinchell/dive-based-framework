    description: "Identified guilt and anxiety; took time to feel and accept it. Observed pattern of using dives to face problems and reduce anxiety. Acknowledged desire to do more but recognized limits. Contextualized emotions as part of a high-pressure environment with heightened emotions from others. Chose to reduce emotional load by allowing others to feel without trying to manage it. Felt slightly better afterward."

reflection: "Three writing dives totaling 90 minutes, facing acute anxiety and aversion while deploying multiple coping skills (exercise, music, singing, gaming, relational check-ins). 2.7 hours of focused work total, including admin and meeting work, spanning from 1030–1530 (5 hours). Feeling weak but determined; fatigue is clearly a factor."
