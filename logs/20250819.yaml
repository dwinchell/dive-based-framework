sleep:

reflections:
  - "I overslept my wakeup alarm, woke 3min before a meeting, didn't take meds at that time and was distracted even from the next meds reminder at 11. Remembered when I started the daily log at 11:45. So ... good wake up times and journaling with med tracking continue to matter."
  - "Stayed up late reading again. Reached for it as a comfort because I was anxious. Tried Klonopin and waiting a half hour and sitting with wife first. Didn't work. Just got tired. Should have tried meditation, gaming, exercise instead, but just too tired and overwhelmed."
