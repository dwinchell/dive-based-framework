    description: "Exhaustion, frustration, desperation, self-disappointment/betrayal, sadness → embodied resolve (clenched jaw, fire in chest/arms). Message: 'I’m here now. It’s okay. You can do this.' Context: runaway YouTube loop → fatigue and disappointment. Adaptation: cold-turkey high-dissociation activities; build alternative menu; Fighter engaged to end loops and protect sleep (harsh, never cruel)."

    description: "Name: exhilarated, slightly anxious, energetic, happy. Feel: foot jiggling, muscles tensed, slightly hunched, euphoric chest warmth, elevated body temperature, internal shaky energy without tremor. When: first noticed after discovering high-adrenaline games. Accept: accept exhilarated/anxious/energetic/happy state. Observe: gamed without dissociation. Contextualize: Fighter is active; game choices were intentionally limited. Adjust: wind down gently for the night; continue with the plan."
