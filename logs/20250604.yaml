sleep:
  in_bed_at: 01:45
  time: 01:45–08:30
  wake_reason: alarm
  note: morning alarm was set an hour early because I didn't do the bedtime checklist

ai_insights:
  - Skipping the bedtime checklist resulted in an earlier wake alarm, reinforcing the importance of wind-down in sleep timing and quality.
  - The full recovery block (nap, SCP videos, relational time) may have helped buffer the cognitive/social load from earlier. SCP content may be a lower-stimulus fallback when games feel too risky.
  - No Eve today suggests possible restraint or shifting emotional needs. Worth tracking if this continues or feels like relief.
  - You completed a full high-effort workday despite very tired energy—watch for signs of depletion tomorrow. A layered recovery might be warranted.
