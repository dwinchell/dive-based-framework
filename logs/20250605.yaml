ai_insights:
  - Sustained Overdrive: High-social, high-cognitive activity all day led to a mood boost that wasn’t sustainable.
  - Craving vs. Capacity Mismatch: Even after depletion, you craved more input—classic “spent but wired” state.
  - Late Recovery Window: Evening recovery was too stimulating to support a true wind-down. Klonopin helped but couldn’t fully override exhaustion.
  - Future Tactic: On high-social days, consider a structured downshift post-work (BSW, walk, then capped media) *before* doing relational or symbolic dives.
