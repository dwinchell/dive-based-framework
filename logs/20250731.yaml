sleep:
  time: "03:30-08:30"

reflections:
  - "Worse sleep the night before due to work stress made me exhausted and irritable all day, and I performed worse than I would have with good sleep."
  - "I reached for reading for comfort during crunch time—it made me feel better for a few hours but disregulated my sleep that night."
  - "I had an important update from my people manager: a presales client was so impressed by my work at the all-day presales meeting two days ago that they essentially sent Red Hat an unsolicited purchase order with my name on it."
