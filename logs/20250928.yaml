    description: "Very underestimated, tired, unmotivated, anxious, frozen. Decided to compromise on games and fantasy because mind was drifting in directions I didn't want (memories of inflation). But feel disinterested in games. This is the moment of weakness when I was falling into books. Desperate for comfort and stimulus but no energy. Books take no energy and immediately solve those needs, but the cost is not worth it and I will not do it."
