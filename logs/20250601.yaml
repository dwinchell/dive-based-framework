ai_insights:
  - You effectively downshifted throughout the day once early signs of illness appeared—napping, light play, and relational support.
  - Proactive mitigation (testing, med planning, support from spouse) reduced background stress, enabling smoother adaptation.
  - Though you stayed up late, the hour-earlier shift suggests natural correction—likely nudged by low capacity rather than force.
  - "Tomorrow’s priority: protect recovery conditions. Avoid cognitive spikes, preserve rest windows, and monitor for new symptoms."
