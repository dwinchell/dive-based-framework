    description: Switched to reading in the early evening and continued until 05:30
reflections:
  - Did not track timestamps after mid-afternoon.
  - Played Eve most of the day.
  - Cleaned up cat puke.
  - No naps.
  - Switched to reading in the early evening and stayed up until 05:30.
ai-insights:
  - Eve continues to dominate engagement time, though it was punctuated by a stabilization effort mid-day.
  - Physical triggers led to brief regulation via exercise, but likely insufficient to prevent later sleep drift.
  - Late switch to a reading dive contributed to major sleep schedule erosion—no natural winddown buffer observed.
  - Sustained overactivation without naps or proper disengagement suggests growing cognitive fatigue under the surface.
