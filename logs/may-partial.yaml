      Aimed to shift internal state toward greater long-term resilience.

  - type: Meal
    time: 17:00
    context: Lunch out
    description: >
      Chose to go out for lunch instead of defaulting to delivery.

    time: ~17:30
    mood: High
    energy: Creative
    notes: >
      Feeling uplifted and creatively energized post-exercise and lunch out.
      Strong drive to engage — risk of misdirected hyperfocus is present.
      Intentional focus is needed to channel energy toward high-priority report work instead of burning EF on lower-impact tasks.

  - type: Physical State
    time: ~17:30
    notes: >
      Noticed knee discomfort post-run.
      Likely due to quad tightness or impact-related strain.
      May require immediate attention to prevent compounding fatigue or interference with sleep.

  - type: Gaming Dive
    time: 23:00–02:45
    game: EVE Online
    description: >
      Intended as a gentle wind-down, but evolved into a full dive.
      Gameplay remained low-stimulus and relaxing in a dim environment.
      Strong engagement driven by AI-based tutorial progression and steady learning loop.
      Dive was enjoyable but extended later than ideal for sleep timing.

in_bed:
  time: 03:15
  wind_down:
    time: 02:45–03:15
    description: >
      Basic bedtime routine executed after extended gaming dive.
      No additional structured wind-down protocol; minimal prep before sleep onset.
    medication: 5mg melatonin
    breathe_right_strip: Yes
    hydration_status: Slightly low (no significant intake in last few hours)
    audio_environment: BetterSleep app (replacing Poe playlist)

pre_sleep_boosters:
  actions:
    - Light lower body stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves)
    - Deep breathing / short body scan
    - Brief positive recall (1–2 good things from the day)

  energy: Physically rested but mentally foggy with slight headache

meds: taken at 09:15

activities:
  - type: Sustain Block
    time: 09:00–09:15
    description: >
      Refilled weekly medicine organizer.
      Contributes to long-term stability and reduces risk of missed doses.

  - type: Planning Block
    time: 09:15–10:15
    description: >
      Updated framework definition and version-controlled the daily log.
      Strengthens consistency, reflection, and self-regulation infrastructure for the day ahead.

  - type: Post-Sleep Protocol
    time: 10:15–11:00
    description: >
      Completed PSP v2. Included hydration, clothing change, wetting face, hygiene, and light movement.
      Functioned as a full recovery block — helped stabilize mood and cognitive state.

  - type: Environmental Maintenance
    time: 11:05–11:45
    description: >
      Completed cat litter and trash tasks, and made partial progress on cardboard recycling and laundry.
      Session triggered noticeable SR crash within 5 minutes. Became irritable and experienced hunger.
      Light breakfast (small yogurt drink) likely insufficient; drank an Ensure to compensate.
      Lack of sleep also contributed to reduced resilience and heightened sensitivity.
    outcome: >
      Despite physical and emotional resistance, completed high-aversion tasks by pushing through discomfort.
      OCD-related stress (dust exposure, brushing surfaces) compounded load but was managed through planned shower.

  - type: Recovery Block
    time: 11:45–12:10
    description: >
      Full shower to reset physical and emotional state after stressful environmental maintenance block.
      Aimed at relieving sensory discomfort, OCD tension, and SR depletion.
      Served as effective transition into a more stable and regulated internal state.

  - type: State Check-In
    time: 11:00
    energy: Refreshed but foggy
    mood: Relaxed
    physical_state: >
      Slight headache, likely from limited sleep.
    notes: >
      PSP was effective in stabilizing state. Emotional and physical systems feel rebalanced,
      but cognitive clarity still lagging — probable result of 5.5h sleep duration.

  - type: Call
    time: ~12:15
    description: >
      Called Mom. Brief check-in. Provided minor emotional boost and sense of follow-through.
      No major stressors or updates.

  - type: Nap
    time: 13:00–15:00
    sleep_duration: 1h 30m
    hypnagogia: 30m
    description: >
      Initiated nap to recover from physical exertion and SR depletion after morning chores and emotional strain.
      Slept soundly for ~1.5 hours, followed by a 30-minute hypnagogic state — conscious but not alert.
      Hypnagogic period did not feel like true sleep but likely provided partial restoration through rest and sensory disengagement.

  - type: Post-Sleep Protocol
    time: 15:30
    description: >
      Partial execution of PSP v2 following nap and hypnagogic rest period.
      Included: hydration, deep breathing, wetting head and face, light stretching, and a short walk.
      Omitted other components (meditation, etc.).
      Helped reestablish basic physical and cognitive readiness.
      Plan to revise PSP in future version (v3) to distinguish core vs optional elements.

  - type: Substance Log
    time: 15:45
    substance: Caffeine
    amount: 25mg
    source: Energy bar (unintentional)
    description: >
      Accidentally consumed ~25mg of caffeine via an energy bar without realizing it contained stimulants.
      Intake was unintentional and occurred post-nap during recovery window.
      May impact sleep onset or interact with current SR state depending on timing and sensitivity.

  - type: Relational Dive
    time: 15:45–17:30
    description: >
      Went to dinner at a new restaurant with wife.
      Served as both quality time and decompression after earlier SR challenges.
      Environment was novel but not overwhelming; contributed positively to emotional connection and mood regulation.

  - type: Gaming Dive
    time: 18:20–02:00
    game: EVE Online
    milestone: Find a shiny and sell it
    description: >
      Long-duration gaming session with moderate engagement. 
      Wind-down began passively toward the end of the session as stimulation tapered.
      Pushed sleep back 30m from nominal target onset of 2:00

  - type: Wind Down
    time: ~01:30–02:00
    description: >
      Passive wind-down mixed into final gaming stretch. Didn't completely follow WDP for the first phase, but completed all phase 2 (bed time) tasks.
      Transitioned directly to bed without overstimulation, maintaining low-light environment.

  - type: Recovery Block
    time: 10:45–12:00
    description: >
      Intended as a standard recovery block, but was disrupted by a major OCD trigger.  
      Responded to the trigger strongly, resulting in emotional overload and compulsive mental processing.  
      Executive function was significantly degraded afterward.

  - type: Unstructured Work
    time: 12:00–16:00
    description: >
      Low-EF period following OCD disruption.  
      Completed miscellaneous tasks without structured planning or clear dive framing.  
      Productivity was mixed; pacing driven more by inertia than intentional effort.

  - type: Nap
    time: 18:00–19:45
    description: >
      Slept from 18:00–19:00.  
      Hypnagogic limbo from 19:00–19:45, interrupted by mother-in-law yammering on speakerphone.  
      Not fully restorative; external disruption prevented deeper return to sleep.

  - type: Unstructured Time
    time: 19:45–03:50
    description: >
      Played EVE too late — gamed until ~03:00.  
      Noticed compulsive engagement patterns; game dominated mental state.  
      Wind-down routine included a long shower, but thoughts remained stuck on game.  
      Entry into sleep mode was delayed and fragmented.

    description: >
      Took 0.5mg Klonopin to reduce OCD-induced anxiety following major trigger.  
      Intended to stabilize mood and reduce intrusive looping.  
      Will monitor for sedation or rebound effects later in the day.

  - time: 12:00
    type: EF Disruption Analysis
    description: >
      Strong OCD response during recovery block caused acute emotional load, rumination, and likely cortisol spike.  
      Resulted in temporary executive function collapse.  
      Mechanism: amygdala-driven distress impairs prefrontal cortex operations, compounding EF depletion via cognitive loops.

  - time: 1130–1430
    type: Unstructured Mixed Work and Planning
    details:
      - Included a couple of high-social meetings.
      - Emotional regulation load: read something frustrating about work/product direction → anger → solo ranting.
  - time: 1600–1700
    type: Work Meeting
    details:
      - Included emotionally charged sidebar afterward that required significant ER to navigate professionally.
  - time: 2200
    type: BSW + music (incremental activation path)
    sequence:
      - Breathe while lying down
      - Music for mood shift
      - Stand and headphone up
      - Stretch
      - Walk
    notes: Effective at lifting grogginess and increasing alertness. Demonstrates that BSW can be decomposed into sequential micro-actions.
  - time: 0130–0230
    type: "Artistic Dive: Sigil work"
    notes: Light turned back on for visibility. Followed cat into darkness beforehand; aesthetic alignment with cyber/goth/witch theme.

wind_down:
  start: 0100
  actions:
    - Turned off lights
    - Took 0.5 mg Klonopin
    - Changed rooms
    - Took 5 mg melatonin at 0300
  notes: Transition supported by ambient red lighting. Cat-led cue into low-stim mode initiated artistic dive.

mood_state:
  mood: Elevated (likely cyclothymic), shifted to downswing at 1730
  cognitive_state: Brain tired, low motivation, easily bored unless highly stimulating

issues:
  - description: Repetitive stress pain in hand and wrist
    time: ~2130
    context: New mouse appears to be causing injury. Old preferred model discontinued.
    status: Last of backup stock has failed. Replacement search unsuccessful after months.
    emotional_impact: High — potential loss of key input device for work and self-regulation.
  - description: Knee pain returned
    time: ~2200
    notes: |
      Chronic issue. Foam rolling quads helps but requires getting on floor,
      which triggers OCD about cleanliness. Cleaning the floor is EF-intensive and often
      blocks the task. Net result: stabilization task avoided due to cascading blockers.

stabilization_tasks:
  - task: Repair or custom-build RSI-safe mouse
    urgency: High
    load: Very high
    status: Deferred until system is more stable
    notes: Attempted once before; now required for sustainable function.
  - task: Use foam roller on quads to reduce knee pain
    benefit: High
    barrier: Floor access triggers OCD → cleaning loop → ADHD EF failure
    status: Avoided due to cascading blockers

  - "13:00–14:30: Recovery break — emotional mindfulness, nap, music. Felt better upon waking"

  time: 02:45-08:45

  notes: Brief waking at 06:45; light-blocking mask fell off again despite haircut — urgent stabilization task
  energy: Slightly Tired

reflections:
  - "Made good progress yesterday by avoiding destabilizing dives."
  - "Goal today: incorporate a high-stimulus dive that isn’t destabilizing; will require careful timing, content selection, and possibly other safeguards."
  - "It’s okay to engage in long, immersive activities—what matters is doing so in a way that preserves stability."
  - "Avoid framing choices about long immersive activities as permanent denial. This is about **strategy**, not **self-deprivation**."
  - "Honoring your needs includes designing ways to experience what you care about safely."
  - "✅ Noticed hunger early and ate before it caused destabilization"
  - "✅ Completed BSW incrementally despite low state"
  - "✅ Handled OCD trigger with brief exposure/mindset shift"
  - "⚠️ Ruminated unproductively on interpersonal conflict"
  - "🔧 Adjustment: Use mindfulness process next time interpersonal rumination starts"
  - "Feeling guilty about multiple recovery blocks during the workday."
  - "Lack of external pressure makes self-directed traction harder, even though this time is necessary."
  - "Desire to 'level up' and stabilize is strong—partly to gain momentum and reduce reset cycles."
  - "Concern: even temporary sustained progress may be hard to achieve. Fear of falling short despite effort."
  - "Reflection and framework work felt productive; used emotional integration effectively, recognized a repeated SR failure point, and built a concrete behavioral response plan."
  - "Mood was *relatively* stable today despite multiple emotional stressors. Recovered quickly from each, suggesting the elevated cyclothymic disruption from the missed meds may have passed and baseline reactivity has returned."
  - "Met both goals for the day."
  - "Working on Starburst instead of gaming was a good decision that led to brief disappointment but I recovered effectvely using EIP"

  - time: 16:00
    name: pain, desperation, stimulus craving, fatigue, physical hunger
    feel: check
    accept: check
    observe: doing the process, following the framework, making careful decisions; already tried eating, not enough
    contextualize: low SR, fatigue; recurring pattern of craving + hunger late-day
    adjust: go out for dinner — food + light movement + environment change

  - time: 23:15
    name: sadness and disappointment from missing today’s high-stim dive after skipping yesterday's
    feel: check
    accept: check
    observe: chose to prioritize something important instead
    contextualize: Starburst had languished, this helps career and eases future anxiety; urgency due to narrow window
    adjust: schedule and plan a high-stim dive for tomorrow — something to look forward to

meds: Taken in morning

goals:
  - Enjoy high-stim dive
  - Welcome wife home and support her

sleep_target:
  onset: 02:00

activities:
  - "09:00–10:45: Morning checklist, unstructured work, gathered info for financial planner"
  - "10:45–11:45: BSW with walk outside, unstructured work"
  - "11:45–13:00: Work dive for meetings and quick scope work"
  - "13:00: EIP – Name: frustration. Felt and accepted. Observe: attended meeting about a frustrating task. Tone on meeting revealed frustration. Followed up by working on action item. Context: working on a recurring task that continues to not bear fruit. SR is okay and not hungry. Adjustment: do breathing now. In future, when feeling frustration during meeting, breathe and smile. Listen to my tone of voice so that I can modulate it to maintain positive perception and make others feel better about the situation and effectively provide a path forward."
  - "13:00–15:00: Cleaning dive. Hyperfocused. Wanted wife to come home to a clean house. Amazingly low on OCD intrusive thoughts!"
  - "15:00–18:00: Picked up car, ate dinner, finished some cleaning tasks. OCD triggered when the cat made a mess and I had to clean that."
  - "18:00: Reflection – I'm not sure why the OCD is so manageable today, but I'll take it!"
  - "18:00: EIP – Name: disappointment. Felt slight disappointment about running late on cleaning tasks, cutting into dive time. Context: Had a productive day and delayed gratification; this dive had already been delayed from yesterday. EIP helped. Adjustment: Enjoy the remaining hour and make up some me-time this weekend."
  - "18:00–20:00: Gaming dive – sort of. Tried to mod Skyrim instead of playing it."
  - "20:00–01:00: Spent time with wife and worked more on modding Skyrim"
  - "01:00–04:00: Stayed up getting the mods to work and then playing them. RIP schedule."
  - "04:00–04:20: Bedtime checklist"

additional_reflections:
  - Still no high-stim dive … configuring mods before plaing was a poor plan, despite the roleplay potential. Should have waited on that until a longer block was available. The urge to find closure fixing the mods (predictable) and then relieve the tension of anticipation resulted in me making a poor choice to continue after winddown should have started which resulted in an extended dive which resulted in very significant sleep disruption.
  - Goals complete!

meds: taken at 11:00

activities:
  - bare minimum morning routine around 11
  - 11:00-17:15 – hyperfocused work dive, fueled by high mood and high stimulus. Massive progress on a priority. Stopped only briefly for food. Ignored a lesser priority task which is now at risk, but can be addressed tomorrow.
  - "recovery dive in the evening and night: went outside and meditated, did a BSW with a long walk on the nature trail, napped for an hour, ate dinner, did a relational dive helping wife plan her career, followed by more intimate relational time together."
  - winddown started at midnight with giving cat his meds — this will serve as a future anchor for externally bounded immersion. Cleaned cat box, showered, and began planning (may be too high stim, but it's urgent due to psych appointment in the morning). Logged at 01:00. Winddown was scheduled for 00:45 (based on a planned 2:45 sleep onset), so this is ahead of schedule.
