    type: "EIP"
    description: "Name: heartache, sadness, grief, guilt. Feel: stabbing chest pain, tears, brow furrowed. When: breakup-like pattern; post-marriage grief. Accept: feelings are real; old days are gone; Bachelor did its job. Observe: many comforts failed; pressure on chest, stomach-down position, breathing helped; shame/self-judgment present. Contextualize: ~5h sleep, ER weak, emotional processing yesterday, resisted gaming, recently went cold turkey on fiction/AI RPGs. Adjust: talk to Therapist (and likely wife); find safe outlet; stick to plan—no fiction, limit games, avoid dissociative loops."
