reflection: |
  This was a recovery day. I did great during the day, using layered recovery including a planned immersion session. 
  The evening got out of control with unbounded immersion and I stayed up too late playing AI RPGs. 
  If I can introduce planned immersion to AI RPGs, it will help next time.
