  time: 04:30-11:30
  notes: "Mask fell off"

ai_insights:
  - You’re likely in a high-stimulus recovery mode: heavy EVE play and a long nap suggest you were seeking rest and regulation after prior exertion.
  - The 3:30 bedtime and 4:30 sleep onset reinforce a misaligned circadian rhythm. The mask falling off may be contributing to sleep quality issues.
  - Sore throat may indicate emerging illness or overstimulation. Consider a recovery-focused protocol tomorrow: hydration, light food, and less screen time.
  - Lack of tracking suggests low executive capacity. Pre-committing to minimal structure (e.g., check-in alarms, recovery block) might help you regain traction without friction.
