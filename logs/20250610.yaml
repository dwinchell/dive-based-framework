day_start: '11:00'
sleep:
  time: 05:15–11:00
  in_bed_at: 04:40
  wake_reason: alarms
  energy: slightly tired
  mood: slightly elevated
reflections:
  - Noticed sleep dysregulation starting, which is common for me on vacation.
  - Decided to return to frequent prompting to improve traction on goals and stabilize routine.
  - Set target sleep onset at 03:15 with winddown alarm for 01:15.
  - Ended Eve session at 01:00 and got in bed at 02:15.
  - Couldn't sleep due to excitement and cognitive overactivation from Eve learning.
  - Got up at 03:15 after 30 minutes of audio-based winddown failed to settle brain.
  - Tried to close the cognitive loop by diving into learning. It worked, but I stayed up too long.
  - Feel like my brain can rest now.
ai-insights:
  - Sliding into vacation-pattern sleep drift; conscious countermeasure (alarm-based winddown) is a strong stabilizing move.
  - Reintroducing frequent prompting should help regain traction on vacation goals without overcorrecting rest needs.
  - User is showing strong self-awareness and applying countermeasures (e.g., winddown alarm) early, before drift becomes entrenched.
  - Transition from high-stim play to bed was over an hour—this may be too long a window to preserve sleep onset timing unless paired with low-stimulus winddown.
  - This is a classic post-euphoric learning surge, where mastery excitement overrides sleep pressure.
  - It may help to create a light, non-Eve buffer activity (e.g., sensory reset, journaling, or passive media) to bleed off the mental momentum before attempting sleep again.
  - Completing the cognitive loop is often necessary for sleep after euphoric overactivation, especially in mastery-driven dives.
  - Overshooting time cost is a known risk—might benefit from setting a time limit or using a “containment ritual” (e.g., notes + bookmark) next time to externalize the loop without full re-immersion.
