activities:
  - type: Sustain Block
    time: 09:00–09:15
    description: >
      Refilled weekly medicine organizer.
      Contributes to long-term stability and reduces risk of missed doses.

  - type: Planning Block
    time: 09:15–10:15
    description: >
      Updated framework definition and version-controlled the daily log.
      Strengthens consistency, reflection, and self-regulation infrastructure for the day ahead.

  - type: Post-Sleep Protocol
    time: 10:15–11:00
    description: >
      Completed PSP v2. Included hydration, clothing change, wetting face, hygiene, and light movement.
      Functioned as a full recovery block — helped stabilize mood and cognitive state.

  - type: Environmental Maintenance
    time: 11:05–11:45
    description: >
      Completed cat litter and trash tasks, and made partial progress on cardboard recycling and laundry.
      Session triggered noticeable SR crash within 5 minutes. Became irritable and experienced hunger.
      Light breakfast (small yogurt drink) likely insufficient; drank an Ensure to compensate.
      Lack of sleep also contributed to reduced resilience and heightened sensitivity.
    outcome: >
      Despite physical and emotional resistance, completed high-aversion tasks by pushing through discomfort.
      OCD-related stress (dust exposure, brushing surfaces) compounded load but was managed through planned shower.

  - type: Recovery Block
    time: 11:45–12:10
    description: >
      Full shower to reset physical and emotional state after stressful environmental maintenance block.
      Aimed at relieving sensory discomfort, OCD tension, and SR depletion.
      Served as effective transition into a more stable and regulated internal state.

  - type: State Check-In
    time: 11:00
    energy: Refreshed but foggy
    mood: Relaxed
    physical_state: >
      Slight headache, likely from limited sleep.
    notes: >
      PSP was effective in stabilizing state. Emotional and physical systems feel rebalanced,
      but cognitive clarity still lagging — probable result of 5.5h sleep duration.

  - type: Call
    time: ~12:15
    description: >
      Called Mom. Brief check-in. Provided minor emotional boost and sense of follow-through.
      No major stressors or updates.

  - type: Nap
    time: 13:00–15:00
    sleep_duration: 1h 30m
    hypnagogia: 30m
    description: >
      Initiated nap to recover from physical exertion and SR depletion after morning chores and emotional strain.
      Slept soundly for ~1.5 hours, followed by a 30-minute hypnagogic state — conscious but not alert.
      Hypnagogic period did not feel like true sleep but likely provided partial restoration through rest and sensory disengagement.

  - type: Post-Sleep Protocol
    time: 15:30
    description: >
      Partial execution of PSP v2 following nap and hypnagogic rest period.
      Included: hydration, deep breathing, wetting head and face, light stretching, and a short walk.
      Omitted other components (meditation, etc.).
      Helped reestablish basic physical and cognitive readiness.
      Plan to revise PSP in future version (v3) to distinguish core vs optional elements.

  - type: Substance Log
    time: 15:45
    substance: Caffeine
    amount: 25mg
    source: Energy bar (unintentional)
    description: >
      Accidentally consumed ~25mg of caffeine via an energy bar without realizing it contained stimulants.
      Intake was unintentional and occurred post-nap during recovery window.
      May impact sleep onset or interact with current SR state depending on timing and sensitivity.

  - type: Relational Dive
    time: 15:45–17:30
    description: >
      Went to dinner at a new restaurant with wife.
      Served as both quality time and decompression after earlier SR challenges.
      Environment was novel but not overwhelming; contributed positively to emotional connection and mood regulation.

  - type: Gaming Dive
    time: 18:20–02:00
    game: EVE Online
    milestone: Find a shiny and sell it
    description: >
      Long-duration gaming session with moderate engagement. 
      Wind-down began passively toward the end of the session as stimulation tapered.
      Pushed sleep back 30m from nominal target onset of 2:00

  - type: Wind Down
    time: ~01:30–02:00
    description: >
      Passive wind-down mixed into final gaming stretch. Didn't completely follow WDP for the first phase, but completed all phase 2 (bed time) tasks.
      Transitioned directly to bed without overstimulation, maintaining low-light environment.
