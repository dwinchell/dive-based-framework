kind: Multiday Analysis

summary:
  - Vacation decompressing is working: sleep quality has improved, and mood is consistently high
  - Day 1 highlighted burnout-induced social fatigue; Days 2–3 showed better relational balance and attunement
  - Stabilization tasks resumed on Day 3, signaling cognitive rebound
  - Mild OCD tendencies (e.g., double showers) should be monitored under low-structure conditions
  - Emotional recovery appears to be progressing through naps, intimacy, and EIPs
  - Eve remains a core stimulus/comfort anchor but has not yet disrupted relational or self-care goals
