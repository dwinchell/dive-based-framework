sleep_target:
  onset: 02:00

activities:
  - 09:00–10:45: Morning checklist, unstructured work, gathered info for financial planner
  - 10:45–11:45: BSW with walk outside, unstructured work
  - 11:45–13:00: Work dive for meetings and quick scope work
  - 13:00: EIP – Name: frustration. Felt and accepted. Observe: attended meeting about a frustrating task. Tone on meeting revealed frustration. Followed up by working on action item. Context: working on a recurring task that continues to not bear fruit. SR is okay and not hungry. Adjustment: do breathing now. In future, when feeling frustration during meeting, breathe and smile. Listen to my tone of voice so that I can modulate it to maintain positive perception and make others feel better about the situation and effectively provide a path forward.
  - 13:00–15:00: Cleaning dive. Hyperfocused. Wanted wife to come home to a clean house. Amazingly low on OCD intrusive thoughts!
  - 15:00–18:00: Picked up car, ate dinner, finished some cleaning tasks. OCD triggered when the cat made a mess and I had to clean that.
  - 18:00: Reflection – I'm not sure why the OCD is so manageable today, but I'll take it!
  - 18:00: EIP – Name: disappointment. Felt slight disappointment about running late on cleaning tasks, cutting into dive time. Context: Had a productive day and delayed gratification; this dive had already been delayed from yesterday. EIP helped. Adjustment: Enjoy the remaining hour and make up some me-time this weekend.
  - 18:00–20:00: Gaming dive – sort of. Tried to mod Skyrim instead of playing it.
  - 20:00–01:00: Spent time with wife and worked more on modding Skyrim
  - 01:00–04:00: Stayed up getting the mods to work and then playing them. RIP schedule.
  - 04:00–04:20: Bedtime checklist

additional_reflections:
  - Still no high-stim dive … configuring mods before plaing was a poor plan, despite the roleplay potential. Should have waited on that until a longer block was available. The urge to find closure fixing the mods (predictable) and then relieve the tension of anticipation resulted in me making a poor choice to continue after winddown should have started which resulted in an extended dive which resulted in very significant sleep disruption.
  - Goals complete!
