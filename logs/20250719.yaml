ai-insights: |
  - You sustained a deliberate recovery flow throughout the day, leaning into low-stimulus activities (tea, meditation, anime) to manage exhaustion and aversion. This shows strong alignment with Recovery Saturdayâ€™s intent.  
  - The long pre-sleep reading session (3 hours) suggests difficulty transitioning to sleep despite Klonopin earlier in the day. It may reflect residual understimulation or disrupted sleep pressure.  
  - Multiple naps and passive activities point to a need for gentler stimulation. Layered recovery (combining sensory comfort and light engagement) worked well but could benefit from earlier sleep prep to reduce extended wake time in bed.
