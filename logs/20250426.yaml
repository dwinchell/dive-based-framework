    description: "Framework development (Depth-First Life Planning updates); Stimulation: High"
  - time: "10:30–11:30"
    type: "Exercise Dive"
    description: "Strenuous exercise including prep and cooldown; Goal: Maintain HR > 140 bpm for at least 20 minutes (Goal achieved)"
  - time: "Afternoon–02:00"
    type: "Gaming Dive"
    description: |
      Open-ended gaming session for hobby enjoyment and stress relief
      Outcome: Successful; played until 02:00 and considered the experience worth it
      Notes: No external obligations conflicted. Fulfilled emotional goal of decompressing, reconnecting with hobby enjoyment. Acceptable tradeoff of late sleep.
  - time: "14:00–14:10"
    type: "Nap"
    description: |
      10-minute nap post-lunch and post-exercise; napped next to partner
      Emotional comfort likely key to falling asleep quickly; post-exercise fatigue and postprandial relaxation may have contributed
      Outcome: Fell asleep quickly and naturally
      Post attempt: Tried to nap again alone but unable to return to sleep due to wandering thoughts
      Hypothesis links: 
        - Napping with Partner Improves Sleep Onset and Depth (confirming)
        - Strenuous Exercise Accelerates Sleep Debt Recovery (supporting, minor)
  - time: "Evening"
    type: "To-Do"
    description: "Refilled meds (Completed)"
  - time: "02:30"
    type: "Wind Down"
    description: |
      Skipped WDP; Refilled meds, basic hygiene (brushed teeth), Poe playlist (started after getting in bed)
      Total wind-down time: 15 minutes (prior to bed) + passive audio during sleep onset
      Context: High-stimulus gaming dive; vigorous exercise earlier; predominantly relaxed emotional state
      Notes: Skipped WDP intentionally for hypothesis testing; Poe playlist may have provided minor calming influence
sleep:
  time: "03:00–09:00"
  in_bed_at: "02:30"
  total_sleep: "6h"
  notes: |
    Woke due to bladder
    Felt rested on waking; slept well despite short duration
    Could have used a bit more sleep but overall functional
    Experienced long, vivid dreams suggesting deeper sleep cycles
    Overall, a pretty good result for 6 hours of sleep, especially considering skipped WDP
