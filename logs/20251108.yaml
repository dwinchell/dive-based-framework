reflections:
  - "Discovered The Bachelor IFS part"
  - "High longing day"
  - "High craving day"
  - "Exhausting"
  - "The Fighter stepped in multiple times when I was about to give up."
  - "The Strategist helped coordinate coping."

ai-insights:
  - "The internal system displayed strong cooperative dynamics: The Fighter provided persistence under emotional strain, while The Strategist managed tactical coping actions (AI dialogue, sensory grounding, media substitution)."
  - "This collaboration suggests progress toward adaptive integration—protective parts are learning to coordinate rather than act reactively."
  - "The Bachelor’s activation created sustained emotional pressure, but relational and internal support prevented relapse, showing improved resilience and system trust."
  - "Future focus could explore refining The Strategist’s role in planning medium-stimulus substitutions earlier in the craving arc to reduce exhaustion."
