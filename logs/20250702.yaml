sleep:
  in_bed_at: "04:43"
  time: "04:50–09:30"
  wake_reason: "Alarm"
  notes: "No bad dreams, just vivid ones. Woke feeling physically rested and motivated but slightly mentally foggy even after 20 min out of bed and a Breathe–Stretch–Walk protocol."

reflections:
  - "Ignored 11:00 alarm because the changed sound was unfamiliar. It interrupted mid-sentence and was shut off reflexively. Didn't recognize it as important. Strategy of changing notification sounds to get my own attention needs more thought before using again."
  - "Need to do another work dive tonight to finish an overdue CER. Consultant reporting to me skipped a section due to an analysis error, so I'm covering by working late."
  - "Relying on high mood, high stress, hyperfocused productivity to get through a heavy work week. Likely contributed to last night's sleep disruption—pushed too hard without recovery, leading to a stressed brain that rebelled with hyperfocus and distraction-seeking. Stayed up late instead of transitioning to sleep."

ai_insights:
  - "Tight tactical planning worked: avoided drift during the late-night CER dive and AFK Productivity Protocol. The system enabled high output without triggering a hyperfocus binge."
  - "Breathe–Stretch–Walk protocols were critical state shifters, effectively flipping between high and low arousal states. They’re emerging as a reliable onramp/offramp tool."
  - "Late nap and late sleep onset reinforced a late chronotype cycle, highlighting the need for recovery strategies that respect biological sleep anchors rather than forcing abrupt overcorrection."
  - "Physical energy outpaced mental clarity: body felt restored faster than brain. The mental fog suggests incomplete parasympathetic reset."
