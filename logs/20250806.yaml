reflections:
  - "Back spasm woke me early, but it wore off by early afternoon. Continuing to lie down carefully before work helped manage it, even though I didn’t get much additional sleep."
  - "Back pain is now chronic and likely worsened by cumulative impact and tension. Preventative action is needed to avoid another spasm."
  - "The 2-hour nap provided crucial recovery, enabling a strong late-evening dive with emotional payoff."
