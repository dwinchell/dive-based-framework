      Missing work today and taking PTO because I stayed up until 5:45 reading. 
      I feel embarrassed, disappointed with myself, and a little ashamed.

  notes: >
    Mask stayed on all night. No bad dreams. Bladder was not a factor.
    Wound down in bed with Nox Arcana and then switched to white noise + isochronic tones when ready to sleep.
    Tried to get back to sleep for an hour after waking, including a brief attempt to stretch, use the restroom, and brush teeth. Did not work. Gave up trying to get back to sleep at 08:00.
