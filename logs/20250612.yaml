reflections:
  - Pulling out of the initial all-out hedonism binge of vacation.
  - Ready to shift into a more chill, reflective phase.
  - Felt a mild but not distressing pull to wind back stimulus—hard to describe.
  - Feels like clearing something toxic that also built up endurance. Not entirely unpleasant.
  - Felt the hour from 16:20–17:20 pass with existential weight. “The grains of Death’s hourglass slipping inexorably away.”
  - Noted that philosophical reflection tends to return once brain is rested—usually ~3 days after stepping back from career work.
  - This time, the effect may have been delayed by the intensity of recent binges.
ai-insights:
  - User is transitioning from stimulus overload to decompression, marked by shifts toward stabilization and introspection.
  - Physiological signals (fatigue, decompression) align with typical dopamine and parasympathetic rebalancing after high-intensity engagement.
  - Strong philosophical reflection indicates a return to cognitive baseline and may serve as a signal of recovery for future tracking.
  - Despite planned immersion containment, user entered a full reading dive; may benefit from adding stronger pre-commitment rituals or external cues when attempting to pivot into winddown.
