activities:
  - type: Stabilization Task
    time: 10:00–10:45
    description: >
      Completed full morning routine and created a morning routine checklist to formalize and support future execution.

  - type: Recovery Block
    time: 10:45–12:00
    description: >
      Intended as a standard recovery block, but was disrupted by a major OCD trigger.  
      Responded to the trigger strongly, resulting in emotional overload and compulsive mental processing.  
      Executive function was significantly degraded afterward.

  - type: Unstructured Work
    time: 12:00–16:00
    description: >
      Low-EF period following OCD disruption.  
      Completed miscellaneous tasks without structured planning or clear dive framing.  
      Productivity was mixed; pacing driven more by inertia than intentional effort.

  - type: Nap
    time: 18:00–19:45
    description: >
      Slept from 18:00–19:00.  
      Hypnagogic limbo from 19:00–19:45, interrupted by mother-in-law yammering on speakerphone.  
      Not fully restorative; external disruption prevented deeper return to sleep.

  - type: Unstructured Time
    time: 19:45–03:50
    description: >
      Played EVE too late — gamed until ~03:00.  
      Noticed compulsive engagement patterns; game dominated mental state.  
      Wind-down routine included a long shower, but thoughts remained stuck on game.  
      Entry into sleep mode was delayed and fragmented.

  - time: 12:00
    type: Medication
    description: >
      Took 0.5mg Klonopin to reduce OCD-induced anxiety following major trigger.  
      Intended to stabilize mood and reduce intrusive looping.  
      Will monitor for sedation or rebound effects later in the day.

  - time: 12:00
    type: EF Disruption Analysis
    description: >
      Strong OCD response during recovery block caused acute emotional load, rumination, and likely cortisol spike.  
      Resulted in temporary executive function collapse.  
      Mechanism: amygdala-driven distress impairs prefrontal cortex operations, compounding EF depletion via cognitive loops.
