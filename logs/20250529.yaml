  notes: Sleep delayed 20m by in-bed screen time. Pleasant dreams. Need to fix sleep mask.

ai_insights:
  - A full day of productive work—including multiple dives and meetings—combined with short sleep led to cognitive fatigue by evening despite neutral mood. This suggests a hard limit on available executive function under these conditions.
  - The short, low-pressure work session at 22:30 demonstrates that friction-reduction strategies (e.g. review-only dives) can still yield value when tired, especially if emotionally neutral.
  - EVE served as both a sustain break and an evening leisure anchor. Its role may need watching if it starts delaying sleep or replacing richer recovery strategies.
