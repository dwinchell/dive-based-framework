ai_insights:
  - Klonopin likely enabled sleep onset but limited sleep duration to ~6 hours. Future use may benefit from earlier timing or pairing with melatonin to extend sleep.
  - The 21:15–00:15 relational/snack block was long and potentially over-stimulating, possibly reducing sleep depth. Capping relational time after 23:00 could help preserve wind-down effectiveness.
  - Early wake confirmed your prediction. This should be seen not as a failure, but as evidence of accurate self-awareness—your internal model of your sleep window is working.
