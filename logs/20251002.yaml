reflections:
  - "I am ending the fantasy fast today. It began on the afternoon of 9/22 and it is now the afternoon of 10/2, so it lasted 9 calendar days including 8 evenings and 7 full 24 hour cycles. It was a useful exercise. Note that it was during a period of high work stress related to extended work on a report for a difficult client who provided negative feedback on it which created a lot of visibility internally on it. I used alternative coping mechanisms, especially exercise and playing guitar. It was easier to stop guitar than it normally is gaming, except when I used a game-like interface (Yousician). I tried two instances of meditation, one of which worked well, and the other was prevented by persistent rumination. I craved exercise for stress management. I was able to manage stress, though not as time-efficiently. 'Withdrawal'-like cravings for specific activity were minimal and relatively easy to shrug off. Overall stimulus craving was lower than usual. When I did try to game, I was in a 'I don't want to play anything specific' state. I had a successful 'cheat' session where I gamed for 30 min to get my brain stimulated for the work day. Rumination was a serious problem. I hypothesize that gaming helps with that. Sleep did not improve. Rumination kept me awake on some nights. Late exercise / eating / nap kept me awake on one night. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions based on limited data and the presence of a work crunch time as a confounding variable, but I think that fantasy activities have the previously unnoted effect of managing rumination by redirecting my focus. Logs are available but I did not read or write fantasy, limited narrative shows to 2-3 sessions with my wife that had an episode or two (tops 2 hours). I did watch YouTube, but nothing narrative. I did game, but limited in occurrences and duration (maybe 3-4 sessions each no longer than 90 minutes, one only 30 minutes)."
