  notes: Brief waking at 06:45; light-blocking mask fell off again despite haircut ‚Äî urgent stabilization task
  energy: Slightly Tired

reflections:
  - "Made good progress yesterday by avoiding destabilizing dives."
  - "Goal today: incorporate a high-stimulus dive that isn‚Äôt destabilizing; will require careful timing, content selection, and possibly other safeguards."
  - "It‚Äôs okay to engage in long, immersive activities‚Äîwhat matters is doing so in a way that preserves stability."
  - "Avoid framing choices about long immersive activities as permanent denial. This is about **strategy**, not **self-deprivation**."
  - "Honoring your needs includes designing ways to experience what you care about safely."
  - "‚úÖ Noticed hunger early and ate before it caused destabilization"
  - "‚úÖ Completed BSW incrementally despite low state"
  - "‚úÖ Handled OCD trigger with brief exposure/mindset shift"
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è Ruminated unproductively on interpersonal conflict"
  - "üîß Adjustment: Use mindfulness process next time interpersonal rumination starts"
  - "Feeling guilty about multiple recovery blocks during the workday."
  - "Lack of external pressure makes self-directed traction harder, even though this time is necessary."
  - "Desire to 'level up' and stabilize is strong‚Äîpartly to gain momentum and reduce reset cycles."
  - "Concern: even temporary sustained progress may be hard to achieve. Fear of falling short despite effort."
  - "Reflection and framework work felt productive; used emotional integration effectively, recognized a repeated SR failure point, and built a concrete behavioral response plan."
  - "Mood was *relatively* stable today despite multiple emotional stressors. Recovered quickly from each, suggesting the elevated cyclothymic disruption from the missed meds may have passed and baseline reactivity has returned."
  - "Met both goals for the day."
  - "Working on Starburst instead of gaming was a good decision that led to brief disappointment but I recovered effectvely using EIP"

emotional_integration_protocols:
  - time: 16:00
    name: pain, desperation, stimulus craving, fatigue, physical hunger
    feel: check
    accept: check
    observe: doing the process, following the framework, making careful decisions; already tried eating, not enough
    contextualize: low SR, fatigue; recurring pattern of craving + hunger late-day
    adjust: go out for dinner ‚Äî food + light movement + environment change

  - time: 23:15
    name: sadness and disappointment from missing today‚Äôs high-stim dive after skipping yesterday's
    feel: check
    accept: check
    observe: chose to prioritize something important instead
    contextualize: Starburst had languished, this helps career and eases future anxiety; urgency due to narrow window
    adjust: schedule and plan a high-stim dive for tomorrow ‚Äî something to look forward to
