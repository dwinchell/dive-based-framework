activities:
  - type: Post-Sleep Protocol
    time: 12:50–~13:30
    description: >
      Groggy on waking despite full rest.
      Deferring assessments and decisions until completing Post-Sleep Protocol (PSP) to recalibrate emotional and cognitive state.

  - type: Planning
    time: 13:00
    description: Updated daily log and defined todo list      

  - type: State Check-In
    time: Post-PSP (~13:30)
    energy: Alert
    mood: Motivated and determined
    emotional_state:
      - Slight anxiety about running out of SR
      - Concern about missing time-sensitive non-work items due to prior SR depletion
    notes: >
      Post-PSP recalibration successful — significant improvement in energy and mood.
      Determination to engage is present, but undercut slightly by awareness of limited SR reserves and pressure to recover lost time.

  - type: Work Dive
    time: 14:00–16:00
    description: >
      Focused writing session (~2h). Significant progress made on work task.
      Dive was productive and well-paced, contributing to both output and confidence.
    reflections: >
      Emotional state improved post-dive.
      Positive momentum helped ease earlier anxiety about lost time and SR scarcity.

  - type: Exercise Dive
    time: 16:00–17:00
    description: >
      1-hour physical training session. Initiated as a proactive SR recovery strategy.
      Intention was to support cognitive and emotional restoration post-work dive.
    reflections: >
      Physical activity was sustained and deliberate.
      Aimed to shift internal state toward greater long-term resilience.

  - type: Meal
    time: 17:00
    context: Lunch out
    description: >
      Chose to go out for lunch instead of defaulting to delivery.
      Viewed as a positive deviation from usual pattern, with potential benefits for mood, environment, and executive function.

  - type: State Check-In
    time: ~17:30
    mood: High
    energy: Creative
    notes: >
      Feeling uplifted and creatively energized post-exercise and lunch out.
      Strong drive to engage — risk of misdirected hyperfocus is present.
      Intentional focus is needed to channel energy toward high-priority report work instead of burning EF on lower-impact tasks.

  - type: Physical State
    time: ~17:30
    notes: >
      Noticed knee discomfort post-run.
      Likely due to quad tightness or impact-related strain.
      May require immediate attention to prevent compounding fatigue or interference with sleep.
    symptoms:
      - Knee pain (post-run)
    intended_actions:
      - Use roller on quads

  - type: Work Dive
    time: 17:30–19:30
    description: >
      Extended writing dive focused on report.
      Maintained momentum and focus throughout.
      Effectively channeled high-energy state into meaningful output.

  - type: Work Dive
    time: 20:00–22:45
    description: >
      Final push to complete report.
      Finished writing, sent out deliverable, and created summary slides.
      Strong execution block with high focus and closure.
    reflections: >
      Successfully met major work objective for the day.
      Dive wrapped up on a note of accomplishment and follow-through.

  - type: Gaming Dive
    time: 23:00–02:45
    game: EVE Online
    description: >
      Intended as a gentle wind-down, but evolved into a full dive.
      Gameplay remained low-stimulus and relaxing in a dim environment.
      Strong engagement driven by AI-based tutorial progression and steady learning loop.
      Dive was enjoyable but extended later than ideal for sleep timing.

  time: 03:15
  wind_down:
    time: 02:45–03:15
    description: >
      Basic bedtime routine executed after extended gaming dive.
      No additional structured wind-down protocol; minimal prep before sleep onset.
    medication: 5mg melatonin
    breathe_right_strip: Yes
    hydration_status: Slightly low (no significant intake in last few hours)
    audio_environment: BetterSleep app (replacing Poe playlist)

pre_sleep_boosters:
  actions:
    - Light lower body stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves)
    - Deep breathing / short body scan
    - Brief positive recall (1–2 good things from the day)
  notes: >
    Implemented simple recovery strategies to offset screen exposure, late timing, and mild dehydration.
    Aimed at promoting physical relaxation, parasympathetic activation, and emotional calm before sleep.
