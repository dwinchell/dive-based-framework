day_start: 1000

sleep_previous_night:
  time: 0400-1000
  core: 6h
  total: 6h
  notes: Body rested but brain tired. Feel slightly burnt out.

meds: Taken at 1000

activities:
  - time: 1030–1130
    type: Work Dive
  - time: 1130–1430
    type: Unstructured Mixed Work and Planning
    details:
      - Included a couple of high-social meetings.
      - Emotional regulation load: read something frustrating about work/product direction → anger → solo ranting.
  - time: 1600–1700
    type: Work Meeting
    details:
      - Included emotionally charged sidebar afterward that required significant ER to navigate professionally.
  - time: 2200
    type: BSW + music (incremental activation path)
    sequence:
      - Breathe while lying down
      - Music for mood shift
      - Stand and headphone up
      - Stretch
      - Walk
    notes: Effective at lifting grogginess and increasing alertness. Demonstrates that BSW can be decomposed into sequential micro-actions.
  - time: 0130–0230
    type: Artistic Dive: Sigil work
    notes: Light turned back on for visibility. Followed cat into darkness beforehand; aesthetic alignment with cyber/goth/witch theme.

wind_down:
  start: 0100
  actions:
    - Turned off lights
    - Took 0.5 mg Klonopin
    - Changed rooms
    - Took 5 mg melatonin at 0300
  notes: Transition supported by ambient red lighting. Cat-led cue into low-stim mode initiated artistic dive.

mood_state:
  mood: Elevated (likely cyclothymic), shifted to downswing at 1730
  cognitive_state: Brain tired, low motivation, easily bored unless highly stimulating

issues:
  - description: Repetitive stress pain in hand and wrist
    time: ~2130
    context: New mouse appears to be causing injury. Old preferred model discontinued.
    status: Last of backup stock has failed. Replacement search unsuccessful after months.
    emotional_impact: High — potential loss of key input device for work and self-regulation.
  - description: Knee pain returned
    time: ~2200
    notes: |
      Chronic issue. Foam rolling quads helps but requires getting on floor,
      which triggers OCD about cleanliness. Cleaning the floor is EF-intensive and often
      blocks the task. Net result: stabilization task avoided due to cascading blockers.

stabilization_tasks:
  - task: Repair or custom-build RSI-safe mouse
    urgency: High
    load: Very high
    status: Deferred until system is more stable
    notes: Attempted once before; now required for sustainable function.
  - task: Use foam roller on quads to reduce knee pain
    benefit: High
    barrier: Floor access triggers OCD → cleaning loop → ADHD EF failure
    status: Avoided due to cascading blockers

sleep_night_of:
  time: 0315–0915
  duration: 6h
