status_update:
  time: "01:45"
  mood: neutral
  notes: "Started a new billable work project today and hyperfocused on related tasks, which seems to have buffered the downswing. Brain feels like it’s pulling down, but eustress is buoying me."

ai_insights:
  - Hyperfocus as Stabilizer: A 10.5-hour work dive during a cyclothymic downswing suggests that structure and momentum can buffer mood dips. External obligations helped initiate, and coding flow sustained it.
  - Recovery Sequence Effectiveness: Post-nap block covered all recovery types (physical, sensory, nutritional, relational), supporting a successful wind-down. EVE didn’t derail sleep prep.
  - Partner Support Loop: Wife’s interventions (meds, dinner, relational time) served as emotional anchors, helping reduce cost of the mood dip.
  - Eustress Countercurrent: Starting a new billable project generated productive stress that buoyed mood even as internal affective drift pulled downward.
