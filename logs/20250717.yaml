goals:

  - continue to stabilize sleep

meds: Taken at 9:30

sleep:
  time: "1:30-8:30"

  notes: 
    - "Brief wake at 5:45 with no immediate cause"
    - "Laid in bed from 8:30-9:50"

ai-insights:
  - You had high cumulative social and cognitive load today (meetings, work ruminations, and multiple advice conversations about work). This may explain the “out cold” nap and could increase the need for layered recovery tomorrow. 
  - Despite that load, you successfully upheld your sleep stabilization strategy by keeping the couch nap short and letting your wife help enforce wake maintenance. That’s a strong behavioral scaffold. 
  - Repeated evening work focus (dad + friend) may have kept your brain engaged late; consider buffering future evening routines with a non-work anchor.
