reflections:
  - At 19:00, recognized I'm not on pace to finish the book by bedtime. Pivoting to other activities to avoid temptation. Continuing would risk "just another hour" spiral.
  - Stayed up late, but successfully resisted the book. Gaming provided a more bounded alternative.
  - AI insights led to three new principles - Externally Bounded Immersion, Strategic Self-Redirection, Layered Recovery, Narrative Breakpoints
