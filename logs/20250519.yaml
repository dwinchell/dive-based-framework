day_start:
  time: 10:30
  sleep: 6h45m
  energy: Mostly Rested

meds: taken at 11:00

activities:
  - bare minimum morning routine around 11
  - 11:00-17:15 – hyperfocused work dive, fueled by high mood and high stimulus. Massive progress on a priority. Stopped only briefly for food. Ignored a lesser priority task which is now at risk, but can be addressed tomorrow.
  - recovery dive in the evening and night: went outside and meditated, did a BSW with a long walk on the nature trail, napped for an hour, ate dinner, did a relational dive helping wife plan her career, followed by more intimate relational time together.
  - winddown started at midnight with giving cat his meds — this will serve as a future anchor for externally bounded immersion. Cleaned cat box, showered, and began planning (may be too high stim, but it's urgent due to psych appointment in the morning). Logged at 01:00. Winddown was scheduled for 00:45 (based on a planned 2:45 sleep onset), so this is ahead of schedule.
