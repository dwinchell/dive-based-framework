reflections:
  - "Remember to refill meds organizer today so it’s ready for tomorrow."
  - "I’m 3 days into recovery from the work crunch time. I intentionally took 4 days to recover. Letting my mood equilibrate and the SR debt work itself out is part of that. This is unpleasant but normal. It will pass. It’s part of my biology and my chosen path. Go hard and recover. It’s just a messy recovery. I can optimize later, but now’s not the time. Next time I could plan out a recovery strategy with a menu of activities so reading doesn’t take over and slow it down. This is normal. It’s just a tough stretch of my path. I just have to wait it out."
