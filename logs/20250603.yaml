sleep:
  in_bed_at: 02:30
  time: 03:15–08:30
  wake_reason: alarm after initial 07:30 wake and return to sleep
  energy: very tired

ai_insights:
  - Despite the cold resolving, low energy and slight mood dip may reflect residual depletion from being sick plus cognitive strain from multitasking.
  - Extended winddown may signal low stimulation tolerance or avoidance—possibly emotional processing time after relational or work strain.
  - Back-to-back moderate-to-high social and cognitive demands suggest need for a larger recovery window today.
  - Nap helped buffer the evening, but 5h15m of total sleep (after delayed onset) likely deepened exhaustion.
  - Pattern: returning to YouTube late may offer comfort but delays sleep—worth considering a cutoff to protect sleep onset.
