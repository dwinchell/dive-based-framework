      Extended presales-focused work session.
      Segments:
        - 1h: Capturing ideas for Pre-Sales Tiger Team (stimulated post-walk; ideation burst)
        - 3h (12:00–15:00): Ardian presales meetings and analysis (sustained cognitive effort)
        - 1h (15:00–16:00): Pre-Sales Tiger Team follow-up (creative energy still present, SR/EF depleted)
  - time: "17:30–20:00"
    type: "Nap"
    description: |
      2h 30m nap following extended 5-hour work dive without structured recovery.
      Outcome: Substantial nap suggests significant recovery need; may impact sleep onset timing tonight.

      CER Touch Protocol
      Protocol details:
        - Set 2-minute timer
        - Open CER document
        - Write at least one word
        - Observe contents for full duration
        - No obligation to continue
      Intent: Reduce anxiety and avoidance; re-establish cognitive familiarity; prime nervous system for deeper engagement.
      Outcome: Succeeded in reducing avoidance; continued briefly and created structured outline with inline to-dos.
  - time: "23:30–01:30"
    type: "Gaming Dive"
    description: |
      EVE Online. Intentional low-EF, high-agency dive.
      Outcome: Active participation without significant creative/executive load. Numbers went up, rocks were shot, disengaged naturally. Served as gentle deceleration dive before sleep.
  - time: "01:30"
    type: "In Bed"
    description: |
      Transitioned directly to bed after gaming session. No high-stimulus residue reported.
sleep:
  time: "~02:30–09:00"
  in_bed_at: "01:30"
  total_sleep: "~6h 30m"
  notes: |
    Pre-sleep audio: Beyond All Reason (BAR)
    Core sleep: ~02:30–08:00 (woke from bad dream with fighting theme)
    Additional sleep: 08:00–09:00 (fragmented, ended due to full bladder)
    Reflections:
      - Long delay to sleep onset despite relaxing content (BAR)
      - Core sleep disrupted by emotionally intense dream
      - Final hour fragmented; full rest not achieved
      - Sleep pressure likely reduced but not fully reset
      - Morning SR may be compromised; recovery pacing advised
mood_notes:
  - time: "11:00"
    mood: Low
    emotional_state: Anxious
    medication_context: |
      0.5mg Klonopin taken at 09:00. Still feeling physiological effects, but anxiety and low mood persisted.
    notes: |
      Mood not significantly improved despite partial chemical dampening. Suggests underlying emotional/neurological load not fully resolved by medication alone.
physical_condition_notes:
  - time: Morning
    update_type: Recovery
    condition: DOMS
    notes: DOMS no longer present.
  - time: Evening
    update_type: Resolution
    condition: Right elbow
    notes: Elbow injury from earlier this week has fully healed.
reflections:
  - time: Evening
    notes: |
      Attempted a light jog but aborted due to minor foot injury.
      Realization: my body is more vulnerable to minor injury from activities that once felt harmless.
      Grieving that change — it's about recognizing shifting physiological limits.
  - time: Retrospective on April 30
    notes: |
      April 29 was a perfect opportunity for writing: well rested, clear calendar, strong intention.
      An unexpected errand emerged that morning. Attempted to preserve evening block but underestimated ER cost.
      The errand had social friction and uncertainty, draining SR more than expected.
      In retrospect, deferring the errand to the following morning was doable but I didn’t give myself permission to make that tradeoff.
      The misstep was in underestimating its systemic cost and overestimating my ability to recover mid-day.
