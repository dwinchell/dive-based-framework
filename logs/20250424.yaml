  notes: |
    Core sleep:
      - 01:45–07:00 (woke due to bladder)
      - 07:45–09:45 (woke due to alarm)
    Felt more rested than recent days but still physically tired.
    Fragmented sleep helped but wasn't as restorative as uninterrupted core sleep.
    Overall improvement validates stacked protocol and sleep pressure strategy.
