day_start:
  time: 09:00
  energy: Tired
  sleep_last_night: ~6h 30m
meds: taken
activities:
  - time: "09:30–11:00"
    type: "Work Dive"
    description: |
      First work session of the day. Moderate intensity. Executed despite baseline physical tiredness and DOMS.
  - time: "11:00–12:00"
    type: "Unstructured Block"
    description: |
      Planning, lunch, AI experimentation, Dive Framework thinking.
      Notes: Light cognitive work combined with meal. In retrospect, too analytical and creative to allow true recovery.
  - time: "12:00–14:00"
    type: "Work Dive"
    description: |
      Second work session. Cognitive load accumulated heavily by the end.
      Brain engaged continuously for ~4.5 hours total across both dives and planning. Significant depletion at end.
  - time: "17:30–19:00"
    type: "Nap"
    description: |
      1h 30m nap post-dinner following significant cognitive exertion.
      Outcome: Good nap; helped restore physical and cognitive energy.
  - time: "19:00–19:10"
    type: "Recovery Block"
    description: |
      Cold water on head/face, upbeat music, short walk.
      Outcome: Successfully countered post-nap grogginess; full alertness restored within 10 minutes.
  - time: "~19:20–19:25"
    type: "Recovery Block"
    description: |
      Breathing exercises, light stretching, meditation in sunlight.
      Outcome: Further elevated readiness; created optimal baseline for evening work dive.
  - time: "19:30–22:00"
    type: "Work Dive"
    description: |
      Evening work session: reacting to coworker's comments, performing calculations, pair working with a compatible coworker.
      Outcome: Long but productive dive (~2.5h). Positive collaboration sustained focus.
  - time: "22:00–00:30"
    type: "Relational Dive"
    description: |
      Participants: Family. Activity: watching a stimulating medical drama together.
      Outcome: Emotional connection achieved. High-stimulus content may have impacted sleep onset.
  - time: "00:30"
    type: "Wind Down"
    description: |
      Intended strategy: standard wind-down after relational dive. Goal: gradual cognitive/emotional deceleration.
      Actual outcome: stuck watching YouTube 00:30–01:30; high-stimulus content prolonged cognitive activation.
      Adjustment: initiated minimal bedtime routine (30 min, brushing teeth, hygiene) to partially reset state.
      Notes: Failure to shift environment or reduce stimulus cues contributed to initial disruption.
      Pre-sleep routine: started Poe playlist, took 5mg dissolvable melatonin.
sleep:
  time: "02:15–10:15"
  in_bed_at: "02:00"
  total_sleep: "~7h 30m"
  notes: |
    Main sleep: 02:15–09:45 (natural waking, no bladder or alarm).
    Additional sleep: 09:45–10:15 (Sleep Inertia Phase).
    Reflections:
      - Sleep onset delayed by disrupted wind-down but not catastrophically. 
        High stimulus and light levels delayed onset 15 min but did not disrupt quality.
      - Main sleep adequate due to no early wake requirement.
      - Woke naturally; final 30 minutes characterized by pleasant Sleep Inertia Phase.
