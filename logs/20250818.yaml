sleep:
  in_bed_at: "2:00"
  time: "2:30-10:00"

reflections:
  - "Mood stabilized today after 3 days lowered."
  - "No significant back spasm activity today. This is after I started stretching it thoroughly yesterday, and changed my pillow last night. Yesterday was also a low stress day. Any or all of those may have contributed. I did experience discomfort lifting something semi-heavy today (a boxed computer monitor), but not severe and it did not spiral."

ai_insights:
  - "Sleep debt & recovery: You’ve consistently had late nights with 5–7h sleep. 8/17 was a recovery weekend, and by 8/18 you managed stable mood and functional output, but it’s fragile—your system is still running on short nights."
