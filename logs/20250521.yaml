reflection: >
  My mood has been high for three days now. I have been, overall, productive and creative. I have engaged in multiple tasks in multiple domains that required a lot of thinking. I also had a shorter night of sleep yesterday due to a morning commitment. Now my brain is very tired. But still, I'm drawn to think about things — analyze, plan, be creative. I don't just want stimulus, I want to engage cognitively. Which feels great, but it's burning a lot of resources and the crash is going to be rough. I already tried 1mg of Klonopin, and it only slowed me down a bit for a few hours. It would normally have a stronger effect for longer. I would normally sleep.
