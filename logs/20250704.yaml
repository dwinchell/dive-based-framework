ai_insights:
  - Extended reading throughout the day suggests a recovery-oriented, low-stimulus pattern. Severe exhaustion likely shaped choices. Tomorrow may benefit from layered recovery (physical + sensory reset) to shift out of passive recovery mode.

reflections:
  - I stopped reading at 3:00 and got to sleep at 3:45. That means sleep onset was pushed back by 2 hours. Not bad.
