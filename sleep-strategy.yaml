kind: Strategy
name: Sleep Strategy

key-insights:
  - WDP is an effective way to get to sleep.
  - Moving sleep onset forward more than 1 hour per night exacerbates sleep disruption.
  - Nighttime stimulus cravings are the primary barrier to WDP entry.
  - Hyperfocus is also a major barrier to WDP entry.
  - Partial WDP still helps.
  - A lack of clearly identified medium-stimulus activities has prevented recent attempts to downshift from high to medium stimulus.
  - Relational dives push high-stimulus dives later and can reduce WDP window.
  - Work crunches are inevitable but severely disrupt dive, winddown, and sleep schedules.
  - Late-night binges happen and disrupt sleep.
  - Reading novels is the biggest cause of sleep-disrupting hyperfocus.
  - Insufficient logging in the last 3 months limits evidence for specific interventions.

guiding-principles:
  - Commit to using WDP every night, even partially if needed.
  - Plan a target sleep onset and align activities relative to it, but adjust flexibly if disregulated.
  - Respect stimulus needs by planning high-stimulus activities earlier in the evening.
  - Anchor WDP with external cues like alarms and visual signals to reduce time-blindness.
  - Pre-plan night high-stimulus dives with clear end times and use externally bounded immersion to exit.
  - Keep and evolve a menu of medium-stimulus activities to enable gentle downshifts.
  - Accept and explicitly plan for crunch, crunch recovery, and binge days. Disruption is expected; recovery is the goal.
  - Avoid reading novels until sleep is stabilized and a clear mitigation plan exists.
  - Log enough detail daily to enable monthly analytics.
  - Communicate strategy and planned actions to partner for support.

coherent-actions:
  - Commit to using the winddown phase every night except emergencies.
  - Commit to using the bedtime checklist phase nightly; allow selective skipping of non-critical items.
  - ~120m before target sleep onset: Start winddown. Start early if the situation warrants.
  - ~60m before target sleep onset: Start bedtime checklist.
  - ~30m before target sleep onset: Get in bed.
  - Set and update alarms for winddown and bedtime as part of daily planning.
  - Monitor actual durations and adjust timing as needed based on sleep onset patterns.
  - Schedule a daily high-stimulus dive (minimum 30m) earlier in the evening.
  - Identify externally bounded immersion cues for use late at night.
  - Create and maintain a stimulus menu with a medium-stimulus section. Update it iteratively as preferences change.
  - Plan relational dives to start no later than 20:00 and end no later than 22:00 to preserve WDP window.
  - During crunch times and emergencies, adapt as needed, record adjustments, and prioritize partial WDP over skipping entirely.
  - Avoid reading novels for now; re-evaluate monthly with a mitigation strategy before reintroducing.
  - Track strategy related notes and fields including day-type in the sleep section and update each morning.
  - Communicate strategy and needs to partner for accountability and support.

summary:
  - WDP every night (full or partial)
  - Plan activities relative to target sleep onset
  - Pre-plan crunches and recovery phases
  - Maintain daily logging for analytics
  - Communicate strategy and actions

kind: Protocol
name: Wind Down Protocol
abbreviation: WDP
description: "Structured wind-down improves sleep onset and should be preserved and tracked."
strategy: "Consistent, screen-minimized transition into core sleep with phased step-down of stimulus."
phases:
  winddown:
    - Limit light exposure. Dim screens only. TV with lowered brightness is ok. Phone and monitor screens are not. Reduce ambient light.
    - Lower stimulus activities. Step down from prior stimulating activities (high to medium or medium to low).
    - Perform bedtime routine tasks (litter, shower, laundry, etc.)
    - Limit water consumption
  bedtime-checklist:
    - Perform bedtime checklist in bedtime-checklist.yaml
