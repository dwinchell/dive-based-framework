kind: Protocol
name: Redline Reset
version: 1.0

description: >
  A rapid triage routine for re-regulating when the system crosses an emotional or physical redline.
  Designed for use during acute overwhelm, dysregulation, or post-trigger spiral (e.g., OCD cleaning loop, accidental exposure, body panic).

triggers:
  - Acute physical hunger, exhaustion or shutdown
  - Emotional panic, helplessness, or intrusive loops
  - Collapse in ability to prioritize or act
  - Post-trigger exhaustion with unmet basic needs (e.g., hunger, hydration)

steps:
  - **Step 1: Emergency Nourishment**
    action: Quickly obtain safe, palatable calories (e.g., smoothie, crackers, protein bar)
    note: Use delivery or partner assistance if needed; avoid decision fatigue
    
  - **Step 2: Grounding Reset**
    action: Perform a 5-15 minute meditation session or BSW
    note: Aim to interrupt spiraling thoughts and slow physiological arousal

  - **Step 3: Medium-Stim Decompression**
    action: Engage in a mildly stimulating but low-pressure activity (e.g., Dome Keeper, modded Skyrim, walk with audio)
    note: Avoid performance tasks or anything with external stakes

  - **Optional Step 4: Reassess**
    action: After 30â€“60 minutes, briefly reevaluate needs. Decide between gentle reentry (stabilization, hygiene) or extending decompression.

notes:
  - Avoid all judgment during execution. The protocol exists *because* you're not functioning normally.
  - This is not a productivity routine. It is emergency recovery.
