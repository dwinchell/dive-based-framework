kind: Protocol
version: v1
name: Review Only Dive

description: >
  A strategy to reduce anxiety and lower executive function activation by beginning a work dive with low-expectation review.
  Especially useful for high-aversion tasks (e.g., writing, slide creation, report analysis) where initial resistance is high.
  The goal is to gently enter the task environment without pressure to produce. This makes the next dive, aimed at productivity, easier.
  As an added benefit, it sometimes often triggers flow and productivity during the Review Only Dive.

phases:
  - phase: Setup
    actions:
      - Identify target task or artifact (e.g., report, slides, spreadsheet).
      - Commit to "review only" posture — no productivity required.
      - Minimize pressure: remind self that the goal is orientation, not output.

  - phase: Engagement
    actions:
      - Open the document or workspace.
      - Read or scan without editing or taking action unless it feels easy.
      - Identify the easiest tasks to start later
      - Follow curiosity lightly—highlighting or minor notes allowed if organic.
      - Optional: jot down thoughts or questions, but avoid task planning.

  - phase: Optional Transition
    criteria: >
      If natural momentum arises (e.g., an urge to write, edit, solve), allow shift into a productive state.
    note: >
      If no momentum arises, still count the dive as successful for anxiety reduction and setup.

use_cases:
  - Writing dives (e.g., reports)
  - Presentation prep (e.g., slides, narrative framing)
  - Technical reviews (e.g., code, architectures, analysis)

insight: >
  Review-first dives help bypass avoidance circuits by creating a safe, low-judgment entry into task space. Repeated use builds trust in the approach and increases odds of flow-state entry.
