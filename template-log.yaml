# DAILY LOG – STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE (v3)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Conventions:
# - All string values MUST be quoted to avoid parsing issues with colons and dashes.
# - Time format: "HH:MM" (24-hour). Ranges use "HH:MM-HH:MM".
# - Date format: "MM/DD/YYYY" (e.g., "01/31/2025").
# - The top level fields are date, kind, day_start, activities, reflections and ai_insights.
# - The top level sleep field is deprecated.
# - date, kind and day_start` are ALWAYS present. The rest are optional.
# - The only valid fields under day_start are: sleep_last_night, sleep_last_night_notes, meds, energy, mood and notes
# - Core sleep is tracked on the day you WAKE UP.
#   Examples:
#     • "01:00-06:00" on Jan 1 → belongs to 01/01/2025.
#     • "23:00 (Dec 31)-06:00 (Jan 1)" → also belongs to 01/01/2025.
# - Core sleep time is logged in `day_start.sleep_last_night`.
# - Notes about that sleep (quality, interruptions, etc.) go in `day_start.sleep_last_night_notes`.
# - Meds are logged under `day_start.meds`. The value is a time, "Taken" if unknown, or "Missed" if they were not taken that day.
# - If meds were missed, there should be a note about why.
# - Anything else that used to appear under `day_start` should be folded into `day_start.notes`.
# - “Out of bed” is handled as an activity entry.
# - Bedtime and sleep onset events are logged as entries under `activities`.
# - `activities` items may be:
#     • simple strings (quoted)
#     • or mappings with fields `time`, `type`, `description`, and optional `notes`.

# Activities Section
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Each list item can be either:
#   - A quoted string (quick shorthand)
#   - A mapping with these fields:
#       • time: a time range ("01:00-02:00"), point in time ("03:00"), or
#               descriptive word ("night") when exact time is unknown.
#       • type: a one- or two-word category for the activity.
#                Intended to eventually be standardized.
#                Common types: "Meal", "Nap", "Work", "Gaming", "Maintenance",
#                "Stabilization", "Stimulus".
#       • description: a long, human-friendly explanation of what happened.
#       • notes: (optional) commentary, metadata, or long supporting details
#                that don’t belong in the description field.
