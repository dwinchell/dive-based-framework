# ------------------------------------------------------------
# DAILY LOG – STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE (v3)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Conventions:
# - All string values MUST be quoted to avoid parsing issues with colons and dashes.
#   The only exceptions are the root `date` and `kind` fields, which are intentionally unquoted.
# - Time format: "HH:MM" (24-hour). Ranges use "HH:MM-HH:MM".
# - Descriptive / fuzzy times (e.g., "night", "evening") are allowed ONLY to preserve
#   fuzziness already present in source data, not to invent new ambiguity.
# - Date format: MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., 01/31/2025).
# - Allowed top-level fields, in order:
#     date, kind, day_start, activities, reflections, ai_insights, checklist
# - date, kind, day_start, and activities are ALWAYS present. The rest are optional.
# - The legacy top-level sleep field is deprecated.
# - Core sleep is tracked on the day you WAKE UP.
#   Examples:
#     • "01:00-06:00" on Jan 1 → belongs to 01/01/2025.
#     • "23:00 (Dec 31)-06:00 (Jan 1)" → also belongs to 01/01/2025.
# - Core sleep time is logged in `day_start.sleep_last_night`.
# - Notes about sleep quality, interruptions, or context go in
#   `day_start.sleep_last_night_notes`.
# - Meds are logged under `day_start.meds`.
#   Valid values:
#     • a time ("HH:MM")
#     • "Taken" (time unknown)
#     • "Missed" (with explanation in notes)
# - “Out of bed” / “In bed” is handled as an activity entry, not in day_start.
