depth_first_life_planning:
  version: "April 23, 2025"
  overview: >
    A structured system to support high-intensity, depth-first engagement while protecting long-term sustainability.
    It manages self-regulation (SR), emotional regulation (ER), and executive function (EF) through structured planning, recovery, and execution.

  core_drives:
    - Skill Progression
    - Narrative Immersion
    - Intellectual Beauty
    - Relational Purpose

  key_components:
    dives:
      description: >
        Focused work or engagement sessions aligned with one or more core drives.
      structure:
        - Purpose and scope
        - Entry conditions
        - Exit triggers or recovery plan
        - Optional companion rituals (music, location, attire)

    recovery_blocks:
      description: >
        Low-structure time used to restore SR/ER after dives or high-load activities.
      typical_activities:
        - Solitude
        - Music
        - Walks
        - Meditation
        - Naps
        - Low-stimulus media

    stabilization_tasks:
      description: >
        Tasks that contribute to long-term system stability, often low urgency but high impact.
      examples:
        - Cleaning room
        - Fixing gaming rig
        - Organizing workspace or digital tools
        - Improving recovery infrastructure

    sustain_breaks:
      description: >
        Intentional low-aversion pauses to preserve momentum across extended dive cycles.
      purpose: >
        Not meant to fully recharge, but to delay depletion and preserve pacing.
      examples:
        - Sugary drink
        - Music
        - Light physical reset (robe change, hygiene)
        - Ambient content
      principle: "Recovery is for recharging. Sustain is for pacing."

    post_sleep_protocol:
      description: >
        A protocol for recalibrating readiness and stabilizing after waking.
      actions:
        - Hydration
        - Clothing change
        - Basic hygiene (e.g., shaving, combing)
        - Exposure to natural light or gentle movement
        - Delay planning/decision-making until protocol completion
      insight: >
        Initial emotional state post-sleep is often inaccurate; post-sleep ritual corrects for that.

  named_protocols:
    wind_down_protocol_v1_1:
      purpose: >
        Consistent, screen-minimized transition into core sleep.
      structure:
        - T–2 hrs: Dimmed TV screen allowed, no phone screen, reduce room lighting
        - T–1 hr: Full darkness except essential light; brief phone use (alarms only)
        - Sleep onset: Poe playlist + 5mg dissolvable melatonin
      validation:
        - Validated as effective on April 22–23

  formal_principles:
    - name: Wind Down Protocol Effectiveness
      description: >
        Structured wind-down improves sleep onset and should be preserved and tracked.

    - name: Missed Meds Disruption Arc
      description: >
        Missing meds causes predictable multiday destabilization (3+ days). Scope and emotional load should be reduced during this window.

    - name: Solitude & Movement Recovery
      description: >
        Short recovery using solitude and movement (e.g., walks, robe changes, meditation) reliably restores SR/ER and should be prioritized post-dive or during instability.

    - name: Cognitive-Social Load Requires Scaling Recovery
      description: >
        Short, high-intensity tasks (e.g., meetings, collaboration) demand recovery based on intensity—not just duration.

  tracking_initiatives:
    - Wind Down Protocol v1.1 effectiveness
    - Sleep disruptions: bladder status, dreams, nap timing
    - Confirming/disconfirming evidence for formal principles
    - T–2 hr low-stimulus menu development

  terms_and_concepts:
    - 6-Day Edge Rule: >
        Limit on how long full-structure optimization is sustainable while already unstable (~6 days with current system).
    - SR Protected Work Dive (SPWD): >
        Stabilization-first protocol for working in low-SR conditions.
    - Wake-Up Protocol: >
        Structured post-sleep routine for hydration, hygiene, and state recalibration before making decisions.
