depth_first_life_planning:
  version: "5/4/25"
  overview: >
    A structured system to support high-intensity, depth-first engagement while protecting long-term sustainability.
    It manages self-regulation (SR), emotional regulation (ER), and executive function (EF) through structured planning, recovery, and execution.

  core_drives:
    - Skill Progression
    - Narrative Immersion
    - Intellectual Beauty
    - Relational Purpose

  key_components:
    dives:
      description: >
        Focused work or engagement sessions aligned with one or more core drives.
      structure:
        - Purpose and scope
        - Entry conditions
        - Exit triggers or recovery plan
        - Optional companion rituals (music, location, attire)

    recovery_blocks:
      description: >
        Low-structure time used to restore SR/ER after dives or high-load activities.
      typical_activities:
        - Solitude
        - Music
        - Walks
        - Meditation
        - Naps
        - Low-stimulus media

    sustain_breaks:
      description: >
        Intentional low-aversion pauses to preserve momentum across extended dive cycles.
      purpose: >
        Not meant to fully recharge, but to delay depletion and preserve pacing.
      examples:
        - Sugary drink
        - Music
        - Light physical reset (robe change, hygiene)
        - Ambient content
      principle: "Recovery is for recharging. Sustain is for pacing."

    stabilization_tasks:
      description: >
        Tasks that contribute to long-term system stability, often low urgency but high impact.
      examples:
        - Cleaning room
        - Fixing gaming rig
        - Organizing workspace or digital tools
        - Improving recovery infrastructure

    co_logging:
      name: Co-Logging
      description: >
        The practice of using conversational AI as a companion for real-time or near-real-time daily logging, planning, and system reflection.
        Functions include: surfacing patterns, scaffolding next actions, reducing EF cost of structured entry, and serving as a responsive mirror for planning.
    
      usage_guideline: >
        Acceptable only under certain modes (e.g., analysis, scaffolding, reflection), 
        not as a default motivational crutch or substitute for internal regulation.
        Co-logging should support intentionality, not dependency.

  named_patterns:
    - name: Post-Stress Dive Destabilization
      description: >
         After sustained stress or prolonged structured effort, there is a heightened risk that subsequent reward-driven dives (especially high-dopamine ones like gaming)
         will become dysregulated. These dives may begin as restorative or valuable but can overextend, lose meaning, disrupt sleep, and create EF depletion or loss of traction.
         This pattern is distinct from healthy dives—it reflects a mismatch between timing, duration, and post-stress neurochemical vulnerability. Can induce disengagement from
         using framework habits (daily logging, recovery breaks). Increased risk for missing meds. Creates compounding EF, SR, and ER costs that may persist for multiple days.
    - name: Low-Structure Dopaminergic Spiral
      description: >
        A destabilization pattern that emerges during windows of reduced external structure,
        such as post-project release, light work weeks, or recovery days.
        If a high-dopamine stimulus (e.g., games, shows, LitRPG) is introduced during this window
        without counterbalancing structure or traction, it may escalate into compulsive behavior,
        disrupted sleep, EF collapse, and mood or medication destabilization.

  named_protocols:
    review_only_dive:
      - A low-pressure entry strategy that reduces task aversion by starting with passive review instead of productivity.
      - Reduces anxiety about the overall task.
      - Makes planned future dives easier by building momentum and reducing anxiety.
      - Sometimes triggers natural momentum into focused work during the dive.
      - See protocol-review-only-dive.yaml

    post_sleep_protocol:
      version: v2
      abbreviation: PSP
      description: >
        A protocol for recalibrating readiness and stabilizing after waking.
        Can be used after a nap, or as a wake-up routine after core sleep.
        Can be shortened to partial if there is a pressing task.
        Probably takes between 5-30 min depending on number of actions taken.
      actions:
        - Delay planning/decision-making until protocol completion
        - Hydration
        - Food if hungry
        - Clothing change to next activity if needed
        - Wet head and face
        - Basic hygiene (e.g., combing, shaving)
        - Exposure to natural light
        - Breathing exercises
        - Physical movement - stretching, short walk, etc.
        - Music
        - Meditate
      insight: >
        Initial emotional state post-sleep is often inaccurate; post-sleep ritual corrects for that.

    report_writing_protocol:
      description: >
        Structured approach for writing reports efficiently while managing executive function, emotional regulation, and momentum.
    
      phases:
        - phase: Pre-Dive Planning
          steps:
            - Plan two main dives for the report task.
            - Define "good enough" criteria to consider the report complete.
            - Establish clear milestones to create logical stopping points.
    
        - phase: First Dive
          purpose: >
            Reduce anxiety, build momentum, and set up easier second dive.
          activities:
            - Create an outline.
            - Triage key sections.
            - Begin easiest sections of writing first.
    
        - phase: Second Dive
          purpose: >
            Fill in core content based on the structure and momentum created in the first dive.
          activities:
            - Expand on outline sections.
            - Complete primary body text.
    
        - phase: Additional Dives (if needed)
          notes: >
            Only add additional dives if necessary to polish, revise, or complete remaining sections.
    
      guidelines:
        - Take opportunities to write sections when they feel easy, even if out of order.
        - Avoid spending excessive time perfecting any single section.
        - Plan significant recovery breaks between writing dives.
        - Use sustain breaks proactively during long writing dives to preserve pacing and prevent burnout.
    
      purpose: >
        Maintain emotional momentum, reduce aversion, optimize flow, and ensure high-quality output without unnecessary executive function depletion.

    wind_down_protocol:
      version: v2
      abbreviation: WDP
      description: >
        Structured wind-down improves sleep onset and should be preserved and tracked.
      strategy: >
        Consistent, screen-minimized transition into core sleep with phased step-down of stimulus.
      phases:
        initial_winddown:
          - Begins 2h before target sleep onset.
          - Dim screens only. TV with lowered brightness is ok. Phone and monitor screens are not except for very brief periods (i.e. set alarm.)
          - Check for morning commitments
          - Set morning alarm
          - Reduce ambient light
          - Limit water consumption
          - Lower stimulus activities. Step down from prior stimulating activities (high to medium or medium to low).
          - Perform bedtime routine tasks (brush teeth, shower, etc.)
        bedtime:
          - Begins 1h before target sleep onset
          - Stop drinking water
          - Brief screen use only for essential bedtime tasks (like setting alarms)
          - Wear FitBit for tracking
          - Short stretch and breathing
          - Hygiene
          - Turn off lights except bedroom
          - Close bedroom doordoor
          - Plug in phone
          - Verify alarms for tomorrow
          - Verify meds location and water
          - Melatonin
          - Breathe Right Strip
          - Sleep mask
          - Turn off bedroom light
          - Remember one positive thing about the day to reduce any anxiety
          - Get in bed
          - Soothing background sounds that are low to very-low stimulus (playlists, isochronic tones, whitenoise, etc.)
          
    BSW:
      description: Breathe, Stretch, Walk. Used as a sustain break, or part of a recovery block or wakeup routine.
  formal_principles:
    - name: Missed Meds Disruption Arc
      description: >
        Missing meds causes predictable multiday destabilization (3+ days). Scope and emotional load should be reduced during this window.

    - name: Solitude & Movement Recovery
      description: >
        Short recovery using solitude and movement (e.g., meditation, walks, breathing exercises, stretching) reliably restores SR/ER and should be prioritized post-dive or during instability.

    - name: Cognitive-Social Load Requires Scaling Recovery
      description: >
        Short, high-intensity tasks (e.g., meetings, collaboration) demand recovery based on intensity—not just duration.

    - name: Protect Critical Days From Optional Interference
      description: >
        When a day is especially valuable for high-priority work, proactively defend it from emotionally or logistically expensive tasks, even if those tasks seem manageable.
        This includes errands, social obligations, and emotionally charged coordination.
        Critical day protection may require additional planning, emotional labor, or modest costs—but the benefit to core task momentum is worth the trade.
        Pause to evaluate whether a proposed task undermines the day’s potential, especially when planning around high-stakes projects.

    - name: Avoid Over-Reliance on Micro-Prompting
      description: >
        Micro-Prompting is many short prompts issued over a short time period. Can be appropriate but must be justified. Prompts should serve a meaningful function: clarity, emotional grounding, structural scaffolding, recovery support, or system evolution. Examples of acceptable use include recovery from significant disregulation, depth-first thinking, time-sensitive adaptation, or the need for fine grained prompt-engineering to address a specific item. Redundant or impulsive prompts should be minimized out of respect for environmental cost.
