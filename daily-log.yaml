      environment:
        lights: Dimmed
        tv_settings: Night mode
      reflections:
        - Wind down exceeded target (1h → ~1h 40m) due to hygiene, wife convo, and BAR
        - BAR may have gone long but effectively interrupted work rumination
        - Entered bed quite sleepy; may offset duration drift

      additional_sleep: 07:45–09:45 (~1.5h)
      total_sleep_estimate: ~6h 45m
      reflections:
        - Felt more rested than recent days but still physically tired
        - Fragmented sleep helped but wasn't as restorative as uninterrupted core sleep
        - Overall improvement validates stacked protocol and sleep pressure strategy

        description: Strenuous exercise including prep and cooldown
        total_exercise_time: 45 minutes
        heart_rate_zones:
          vigorous: 32 minutes
          peak: 1 minute
        goal: Maintain HR > 140 bpm for at least 20 minutes
        outcome: Goal achieved
        zone_classification: Vigorous

      - type: Gaming Dive
        time: Afternoon–02:00
        description: Open-ended gaming session for hobby enjoyment and stress relief
        outcome: Successful; played until 02:00 and considered the experience worth it
        notes: >
          No external obligations conflicted. Fulfilled emotional goal of decompressing, reconnecting with hobby enjoyment. Acceptable tradeoff of late sleep.

    mood_notes:
      - time: Morning
        mood: High
        notes: Mild cyclothymia feeling; energized and elevated mood

    naps:
      - time: 14:00–14:10
        duration: 10 minutes
        context: >
          Post-lunch, post-exercise, napped next to partner.
          Emotional comfort likely key to falling asleep quickly; post-exercise fatigue and postprandial relaxation may have contributed.
        outcome: Fell asleep quickly and naturally.
        post_attempt: >
          Attempted to continue napping alone afterward, but unable to return to sleep due to wandering thoughts.
        hypothesis_links:
          - Napping with Partner Improves Sleep Onset and Depth (confirming)
          - Strenuous Exercise Accelerates Sleep Debt Recovery (supporting, minor)

    to_do:
      - Refill meds: Completed

    wind_down:
      protocol_used: None (WDP skipped)
      activities:
        - Refilled meds
        - Basic hygiene (brushed teeth)
        - Poe playlist (started after getting in bed)
      total_wind_down_time: 15 minutes (prior to bed) + passive audio during sleep onset
      pre_wind_down_context: >
        - High-stimulus gaming dive. Full brightness TV, lit room, mentally active state.
        - Vigorous exercise earlier in the day (45 minutes, 32 min in vigorous HR zone).
        - Predominantly relaxed, low-stress emotional state throughout the day due to gaming dive.
      notes: >
        Intentionally skipping WDP tonight to observe effects.
        Contextual factors (exercise, gaming relaxation) may positively or negatively influence sleep onset and quality.
        Passive Poe playlist may provide minor calming influence.
        Valuable for hypothesis testing on necessity of structured wind-down versus cumulative day effects.

    core_sleep:
      start: 03:00
      end: 09:00
      total_sleep: 6h
      wake_reason: Bladder likely contributed to waking
      reflections: >
        - Felt rested on waking; slept well despite short duration.
        - Could have used a bit more sleep, but overall functional.
        - Experienced long, vivid dreams, suggesting deeper sleep cycles were achieved.
        - Overall, a pretty good result for 6 hours of sleep, especially considering skipped WDP.

  april_27_2025:
    day_start:
      sleep_last_night: 6h
      time: 09:00
      energy: Rested, could have used a bit more sleep

    meds: taken

    activities:
      - type: Exercise Dive
        start_time: 09:35
        end_time: 10:45
        total_exercise_time: 52 minutes
        heart_rate_zones:
          vigorous: 26 minutes
          peak: 8 minutes
        description: Morning workout session
        notes: >
          Uncharacteristic burst of morning energy.
          Main heart rate zone was vigorous, with a notable period in peak zone.
          No external pressure; internally motivated. Positive anomaly.

      - type: Relational Dive
        time: Afternoon
        participants: Mom (plus siblings, unexpectedly)
        goals: 
          - Enjoy relationship
          - Support emotional wellbeing
          - Exchange items
          - Help with projects
          - Identify trees together
        outcome: >
          Dive went great. Emotional goals were fully met.
          Unexpectedly planted trees with mom and her siblings — created a memory that will be long-lasting.
          Significant additional physical exertion contributed to post-dive tiredness.
        reflections:
          - Felt good emotionally afterward; positive bonding and support achieved.
          - Physical fatigue from double exercise (morning workout + afternoon planting).
          - Planting trees together was an especially meaningful and memorable experience.
          - Presence of extended family made the dive more emotionally significant than planned.

      - type: Nap
        time: 19:30–19:45
        duration: 15 minutes
        context: >
          Short nap in the car after relational dive and cumulative physical exertion.
          Likely triggered by combination of physical fatigue and emotional decompression.
        outcome: Brief but restorative nap.

      - type: Gaming Dive
        time: 22:00–00:00
        description: High-stimulus gaming session
        intent: Decompression, entertainment
        stimulation_level: High
        notes: >
          Evening gaming dive focused on high-stimulus content.
          Purpose was decompression after physically and emotionally full day.
          Timing may affect sleep onset; monitoring outcome.

    mood_notes:
      - time: Morning
        mood: High
        notes: >
          Woke with slightly elevated mood.
          Exercise dive further increased mood and emotional energy.

    physical_condition_notes:
      - time: Morning
        physical_state: Significant DOMS
        notes: >
          Experiencing noticeable delayed onset muscle soreness from previous exercise.
          Present before today's dive; may influence later energy levels.

    wind_down:
      start_time: 00:30
      initial_content: DUST sci-fi shorts
      initial_outcome: >
        Ineffective — too stimulating.
        Each short was individually engaging and encouraged continued watching, making it hard to step down.
      adjustment: Switched to Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      final_content: Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      final_outcome: >
        More effective — familiar and less stimulating than DUST shorts.
        Helped create the emotional and cognitive step-down needed for sleep preparation.
      in_bed_time: 02:00
      pre_sleep_routine:
        - 5mg dissolvable melatonin
        - Poe playlist started
      notes: >
        Executed final sleep cues (melatonin + Poe) after winding down with BAR.
        Completed adjusted wind-down strategy after initially rocky start.

    core_sleep:
      main_sleep:
        start: 02:30
        end: 08:30
        duration: 6h
        wake_reason: Circadian pulse (natural alertness)
      additional_sleep:
        start: 08:30
        end: 09:00
        duration: 30m
        quality: Fragmented
      total_sleep: ~6.5h
      reflections: >
        Main sleep was solid despite late sleep onset.
        Woke naturally due to circadian pulse at 8:30, consistent with past rhythm patterns.
        Additional 30 minutes of fragmented dozing added marginal rest but not full sleep cycles.
        Woke feeling tired this morning, likely cumulative physical load.
