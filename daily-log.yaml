    wind_down:
      start_time: 23:40
      protocol: Wind Down Protocol v1.1 (with deviations)

        - 0.5 mg Melatonin at 01:30
      in_bed: 01:20
      media: Beyond All Reason (BAR)
      media_effects:
        intellectual_beauty: High
        narrative_immersion: Low–Moderate
        disengagement: Successful (stopped mid-match)
      environment:
        lights: Dimmed
        tv_settings: Night mode
      reflections:
        - Wind down exceeded target (1h → ~1h 40m) due to hygiene, wife convo, and BAR
        - BAR may have gone long but effectively interrupted work rumination
        - Entered bed quite sleepy; may offset duration drift
    sleep:
      sleep_onset: 01:45
      wake_time_core: 07:00 (bladder)
      additional_sleep: 07:45–09:45 (~1.5h)
      total_sleep_estimate: ~6h 45m
      reflections:
        - Felt more rested than recent days but still physically tired
        - Fragmented sleep helped but wasn't as restorative as uninterrupted core sleep
        - Overall improvement validates stacked protocol and sleep pressure strategy
